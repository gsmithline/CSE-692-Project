If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 1 + 81 x 1 + 54 x 0 + 89 x 1 + 12 x 1\n    which is 277 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 278. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

In the first round, the discount has no effect (\\(\\gamma^0 = 1\\)).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Since there is no current offer on the table, we consider making an initial proposal that maximizes our value.\n   - Calculate potential divisions where our value is greater than 278, our outside offer value.\n\n3) **Decision-Making:**\n   - A division proposal should ensure my share is valued above 278.\n\nTo devise a counteroffer, let's calculate a potential division of items, ensuring my value exceeds my outside offer, and avoiding the five mistakes outlined:\n\n- Consider keeping 2 units of item 1 and offering the third to Player 2:\n  - Value to me: 2 * 95 = 190\n- Consider keeping 1 unit of item 2 and offering the other to Player 2:\n  - Value to me: 1 * 81 = 81\n- Consider keeping 3 units of item 3 and offering the other 2 to Player 2:\n  - Value to me: 3 * 54 = 162\n- Consider keeping 4 units of item 4 and offering 1 to Player 2:\n  - Value to me: 4 * 89 = 356\n- Offer all of item 5 to Player 2 (since my unit value is low):\n  - Value to me: 0 units kept = 0\n\nCalculating my total value for this allocation:\n- Total value = 190 + 81 + 162 + 356 + 0 = 789\n\nThis proposed allocation results in a total value of 789 for me, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 278.

Thus, I want to avoid unnecessarily prolonging negotiations if it results in a better offer not materializing. My decision should avoid needless delays.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - As there is no current offer on the table, I have to make an initial offer.\n   - I must ensure that the value of what I keep is greater than or equal to my outside offer of 389.\n\n   **Let's calculate potential offers:**\n\n   Given I want my value from kept items to be higher than 389, and possibly divide high-value items in my favor. Assume I keep:\n   - All item 1: 3 units, value = 3 \u00d7 7 = 21\n   - 4 units of item 2: value = 4 \u00d7 68 = 272\n   - 0 units of item 3, as there are none available\n   - 4 units of item 4: value = 4 \u00d7 98 = 392\n   - 3 units of item 5: value = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36\n   - Total value = 21 + 272 + 0 + 392 + 36 = 721\n\n   Now I must ensure my offer results in a value that exceeds my outside offer of 389. In the above calculation, the items I keep give a value of 721, well above my outside offer.\n\n   The items I propose to give Player 2 would be:\n   - 0 units of item 1\n   - 1 unit of item 2\n   - 0 units of item 3\n   - 4 units of item 4\n   - 3 units of item 5\n\n3) **Make a decision based on the analysis:**\n   - Since there is no current offer to accept or reject, I will propose the above counteroffer.\n   - This offer ensures I avoid mistakes like proposing below my outside offer or unfavorable distribution.\n\nGiven the analysis, I choose to make the following counteroffer to maximize my outcome.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 0, 4, 3]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means if I wait for the next round and make a decision there, my total value will be multiplied by 0.98. Therefore, any future offer needs to account for the reduced value due to the discount.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Value of Current Offer**: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 4, 3] units to me:\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 72 = 0\n  - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 55 = 55\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n  - 4 units of item 4 = 4 \u00d7 34 = 136\n  - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150\n  - Total value = 341\n\n- **Comparison with Outside Offer**: The current offer gives me a value of 341, which is less than my outside offer value of 386. Accepting this offer would not be beneficial.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffer**: I need to propose a counteroffer that has a value greater than my outside offer, or at least closer to it. \n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis\n\n- **Accept the Current Offer?** No, because the current offer value (341) is less than my outside offer value (386).\n\n- **Walk Away?** Not yet, as it is still possible to negotiate a better offer.\n\n- **Propose a Counteroffer**:\n  - To achieve at least a value of 386, I can modify the proposal to:\n    - Offer [0, 2, 0, 3, 3] to Player 1, giving myself [3, 3, 0, 5, 3].

As it's round 1, \\( \\gamma^{0} = 1 \\). Therefore, the immediate value of accepting a current offer is clear-cut without the discount factor affecting it. However, as negotiations proceed to further rounds, the effective value will decrease slightly due to discounting.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: We need to determine an initial offer that is more valuable than my outside offer.\n\nTo evaluate potential counteroffers:\n\n1. Consider keeping a balanced portion of high-value items (Item 2 and Item 4) for myself.\n\nAn initial proposed allocation for myself (aiming for a value > 744) could be:\n\n- Keeping [2, 3, 3, 3, 4] units for myself:\n\n  - 2 units of item 1 = \\( 2 \\times 40 = 80 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 2 = \\( 3 \\times 54 = 162 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 3 = \\( 3 \\times 28 = 84 \\)\n  - 3 units of item 4 = \\( 3 \\times 77 = 231 \\)\n  - 4 units of item 5 = \\( 4 \\times 48 = 192 \\)\n\n   Total value = \\( 80 + 162 + 84 + 231 + 192 = 749 \\), which is greater than my outside offer of 744.\n\nThus, the offer to Player 2 would be [3, 3, 3, 2, 4], which ensures my receiving items worth 749.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nGiven that making a counteroffer that achieves a total value to myself greater than the outside offer is possible in this scenario, the action will be to propose this specific division.\n\nTherefore, my action will be:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [3, 3, 3, 2, 4]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer.

I should propose a division where I get a higher total value than 981 after considering the discount factor for subsequent rounds.\n\nHowever, as any specific proposal other than the valid action formats specified will be invalid, and given the nature of error avoidance, the best call in this first round, considering the current offer's low value compared to my outside offer, would be to make a counteroffer ensuring a better potential value for myself.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 981. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 42 = 126 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 732 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 3, 2, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 4, 3, 6]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make a decision, let's evaluate the current offer, potential counteroffers, and compare these to my outside offer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside offer value**: 981\n- **Values of the items to me**:\n  - Item 1: Value 33\n  - Item 2: Value 39\n  - Item 3: Value 42\n  - Item 4: Value 58\n  - Item 5: Value 72\n\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - Item 1: 5 units\n  - Item 2: 6 units\n  - Item 3: 6 units\n  - Item 4: 5 units\n  - Item 5: 8 units\n\n- **Discount factor influence**: With \\(\\gamma = 0.98\\), the present value of an accepted offer will be \\( \\text{Offer value} \\times \\gamma^{r-1} \\).\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n#### Evaluate Current Offer\n\nCurrent offer to me: [1, 3, 4, 2, 5]\n\n- 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 33 = 33\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- 4 units of item 3 = 4 \u00d7 42 = 168\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n\nTotal value = 33 + 117 + 168 + 116 + 360 = 794\n\nApplying the discount for round 2: \\( 794 \\times 0.98^{1} = 794 \\times 0.98 = 778.12 \\).\n\n#### Compare to Outside Offer\n\n- Current offer value (discounted): 778.12\n- Outside offer value: 981\n\nSince 778.12 < 981, the current offer is worth less to me than my outside offer.\n\n#### Consider Potential Counteroffers\n\nI need to make sure that any counteroffer is worth more than 981 after applying the discount.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nThe current offer is not better than my outside offer, so I should not accept it. I could counteroffer, but I need to ensure that any counteroffer is better than my outside offer when adjusted for the discount. Here\u2019s a possible counteroffer to maximize my value:\n\n### Constructing a Counteroffer\n\nLet's strive for a division such that my value is significantly higher than my outside offer. For instance, aim for at least 1000 in total value for the items without discount:\n\nExample counteroffer (for me to keep):\n\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 72 = 432\n\nTotal offer to me = 99 + 117 + 84 + 174 + 432 = 906\n\nThis isn't enough, even without considering the discount. Let's readjust to:\n\nOffer to opponent: [2, 3, 4, 2, 3]\n\nFor me:\n- 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 33 = 99\n- 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n\nTotal = 834, discounted value: 834 \u00d7 0.98 = 817.32 - still below outside offer.\n\nRefined example:\n\nOffer to opponent: [1, 2, 4, 2, 3]\n\nFor me:\n- 4 units of item 1 = 4 \u00d7 33 = 132\n- 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 39 = 156\n- 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 42 = 84\n- 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n- 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 72 = 360\n\nTotal = 132 + 156 + 84 + 174 + 360 = 906\n\nFinally, counteroffer where the value exceeds my outside offer post discount:\n\nOffer to opponent: [1, 2, 4, 2, 3]\n\n**Action**: {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 4, 2, 3]}",

Ideally, we want to reach an agreement sooner rather than later to maximize our value.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nSince there is no current offer, we'll focus on potential counteroffers.\n\nLet's calculate the value of keeping various combinations of units, ensuring that these exceed the value of my outside offer:\n\n1. **Offer Example 1:** [1, 1, 3, 0, 0] to Player 2:\n   - My units: [4, 1, 1, 2, 3]\n   - My value: \n     - 4 units of item 1: \\(4 \\times 56 = 224\\)\n     - 1 unit of item 2: \\(1 \\times 53 = 53\\)\n     - 1 unit of item 3: \\(1 \\times 85 = 85\\)\n     - 2 units of item 4: \\(2 \\times 30 = 60\\)\n     - 3 units of item 5: \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n     - **Total Value to Me:** \\(224 + 53 + 85 + 60 + 9 = 431\\)\n     - This is greater than my outside offer of 379.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n- Since there is no current offer to accept, walking away is not ideal as it would just result in receiving 379 which is less than many potential options. Therefore, proposing a counteroffer is the best option.\n\nGiven these calculations, I will make the following initial offer to Player 2:\n \n  **Offer:** [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]\n\n- This allocation maximizes my value over the outside offer and ensures a favorable start to negotiations.\n\n**Action Decision:**\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 0]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The value of accepting or proposing offers decreases with each round due to this discount factor. Thus, it's beneficial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n  - There is no current offer on the table.\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  - I should propose an initial offer where I keep the maximum value or slightly less than my outside offer to give flexibility for negotiation. I should calculate my value and ensure it is greater than 1416.\n\n  - Let's evaluate a potential offer where I keep a majority of the items:\n\n    Offer: I keep [5, 3, 2, 6, 1] and give Player 2 [0, 1, 0, 1, 0].\n\n    - My value of keeping 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n    - My value of keeping 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n    - My value of keeping 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n    - My value of keeping 6 units of item 4 = 6 \u00d7 97 = 582\n    - My value of keeping 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n\n    Total: 195 + 279 + 96 + 582 + 97 = 1249\n\n    This is less than my outside offer (1416), so I need to adjust my proposal.\n\n  - Let's revise it where I keep [5, 4, 2, 5, 1] and give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 2, 0].\n\n    - My value of keeping 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n    - My value of keeping 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n    - My value of keeping 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n    - My value of keeping 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 97 = 485\n    - My value of keeping 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n\n    Total: 195 + 372 + 96 + 485 + 97 = 1245\n\n    This proposal is still less than my outside offer (1416). I'll refine further.\n\n  - Offer: I keep [5, 4, 2, 7, 0] and give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n    - My value of keeping 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n    - My value of keeping 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n    - My value of keeping 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n    - My value of keeping 7 units of item 4 = 7 \u00d7 97 = 679\n    - My value of keeping 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 97 = 0\n\n    Total: 195 + 372 + 96 + 679 + 0 = 1342\n\n    This is still less than my outside offer, though close.\n\nIn searching for an offer to maximize my position over time, a proposal somewhat less than my outside offer can provide room for adjustment without compromising my baseline goal.\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\nConsidering the calculations above:\n\n- I should not make an offer worse for me than my outside offer (mistake 2).\n- My current proposal doesn't yield a higher payoff than my outside offer, but it forms a basis for future discussion.\n\n### Decision:\n\nI will propose:\n  \nOffer: Give Player 2 [0, 0, 0, 2, 1], and I will keep [5, 4, 2, 5, 0].\n\nMy value of keeping is calculated as follows:\n  \n- My value: 195 (Item 1) + 372 (Item 2) + 96 (Item 3) + 485 (Item 4) + 0 (Item 5) = 1148\n\nThis value is lower than my outside offer, which suggests negotiating room while maintaining my fallback position.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]}\n```",

Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. **Analyze the Current Situation:**\n   - My outside offer value is 911.\n   - My private values for each item are: \n     - Item 1: 93\n     - Item 2: 79\n     - Item 3: 85\n     - Item 4: 14\n     - Item 5: 23\n   - The total pool of items includes 5 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 7 units of item 4, and 1 unit of item 5.\n   - The discount factor (gamma) is 0.98, which means future offers will decrease in value each round.\n\n2. **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - **Current Offer (Player 1 offers me [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]):**\n     - Item 4: 2 units \u00d7 14 = 28\n     - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 23 = 23\n     - Total value if I accept: 28 + 23 = 51\n\n   - **Comparison with Outside Offer Value:**\n     - My outside offer is 911, which is significantly higher than 51.\n\n3. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Since the current offer value of 51 is far below my outside offer value of 911, accepting it would be a poor choice.\n   - Walking away would guarantee me a value of 911, much better than the current offer.\n   - Consider making a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 911.\n\n   Since it is round 1, I have the option to propose a counteroffer. Ideally, I aim for a counteroffer that maximizes my value and exceeds my outside offer value, while being realistic in terms of negotiation.\n\n**Counteroffer Proposal:**\nLet's propose a division where I take items with high personal value and ensure the remaining value is reasonable for Player 1.

I'll focus on maximizing my high-value items:\n\n**Counteroffer (as a division where I'm keeping most high-value items):**\n   - I take: [4, 3, 1, 5, 0] (leaving Player 1 with [1, 1, 1, 2, 1])\n\n   Let's calculate the value if we accept this division:\n   - Item 1: 4 units \u00d7 93 = 372\n   - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 79 = 237\n   - Item 3: 1 unit \u00d7 85 = 85\n   - Item 4: 5 units \u00d7 14 = 70\n   - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 23 = 0\n   - Total value = 372 + 237 + 85 + 70 + 0 = 764\n\nThis counteroffer provides me with a substantial portion of my high-value items while leaving something for Player 1, though it doesn't exceed my outside offer value of 911. However, due to the competitive nature of negotiation, it aims to start from a strong initial position.\n\nGiven the lack of information about Player 1's valuations and their outside offer, this is a strategic opening offer that maximizes starting value for myself:\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]}\n```",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1416. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1416. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 39 = 117 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1122 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 2, 7, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    39 x 4 + 93 x 4 + 48 x 2 + 97 x 7 + 97 x 1\n    which is 1400 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1416. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 2, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 2, the value for the accepted offer would be multiplied by 1, and from round 3 onwards, by gamma raised to the power of r-1.\n\n2) **Value Assessment:**\n   - **Current Offer:** If I accept the current offer of [1, 1, 1, 2, 1], my total value would be:\n     - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 39 = 39\n     - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 93 = 93\n     - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 48 = 48\n     - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n     - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n     - Total value = 471\n   - Compared to my outside offer of 1416, accepting the current offer gives me significantly less value.\n   - **Potential Counteroffers:** I need to find an offer that provides me with more than 1416 in value. Only accepting 3 units of item 4 (since item 4 and 5 are highly valued) along with reducing the units of lower-valued items might help.\n\n3) **Decision Making:**\n   - **Current Offer:** Does not meet my outside offer value.\n   - **Counteroffer Exploration:** I need a distribution that exceeds 1416. For example, I could explore the distribution where I keep more higher-valued units.\n     - Exploring an offer of [0, 0, 0, 2, 0] for Player 2, I calculate:\n       - Keeping 5 units of item 1: 5 \u00d7 39 = 195\n       - Keeping 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 93 = 372\n       - Keeping 2 unit of item 3: 2 \u00d7 48 = 96\n       - Keeping 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 97 = 485\n       - Keeping 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n       - Total value = 1245, which is less than 1416.\n     - This offer calculation shows that what I retained still doesn't meet my required value.\n\nGiven the information, I will opt to WALK since the current offer is less than my outside offer and no proposed counteroffer would surmount to my required value.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

The longer the negotiation drags on, the value of the offer decreases due to this discount factor. Therefore, closing early could be advantageous.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer**: There is no current offer on the table.\n   \n2. **Potential Counteroffers**: Let's evaluate a couple of potential initial offers for Player 2 and their values to me:\n   \n   - **Offer [0, 3, 2, 3, 1] (I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 1])**:\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 52 = 104\n       - Item 2: 2 \u00d7 12 = 24\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n       - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n     - Total value = 422\n   \n   - **Offer [1, 4, 2, 4, 1] (I keep [1, 1, 2, 1, 1])**:\n     - My value:\n       - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n       - Item 2: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n       - Item 3: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n       - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 64 = 64\n       - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 68 = 68\n     - Total value = 294\n\nEach of these values is greater than my outside offer of 56, thus avoiding Mistake 2.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince there is no offer from Player 2, it falls on me to make a reasonable initial offer. I want to ensure a significant portion stays with me to maintain a value substantially above my outside offer but also reasonable enough for Player 2 to consider.\n\nTherefore, I will propose the first offer I calculated:\n\n**Offer [0, 3, 2, 3, 1] (I keep [2, 2, 2, 2, 1])**, which ensures a value of 422 for me, maximizing my position without conceding immediately to a poorly advantageous split, avoiding Mistake 3, and leaving room for further negotiation.\n\n**Action:**\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 3, 2, 3, 1]}\n```",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 37 x 3 + 10 x 1 + 26 x 2 + 69 x 3\n    which is 380 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 381. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

This will reduce the overall value of accepted offers in future rounds. However, since this is round 1, the discount factor does not yet apply.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer Value to Me** (offer: [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]):\n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n  - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n  - Total value to me = 0 + 0 + 48 + 7 + 112 = 167\n\n- **Compare Current Offer to Outside Offer**:\n  - Current offer value to me: 167\n  - Outside offer value: 400\n  - Since 167 < 400, the current offer is worse than my outside offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** No, because the offer's value (167) is less than my outside offer (400).\n- **Should I Walk Away?** Not yet, as it's better to attempt a counteroffer first since we have more negotiation rounds.\n- **Propose a Counteroffer**: I need to propose a counteroffer that is more valuable than the current offer and possibly close to the outside offer.\n\nLet's evaluate potential splits to see if I can achieve a value close to 400. For simplicity, I'll try to maximize my control over high-value items, especially item 5.\n\n**Potential Counteroffer Calculation** (retain more of item 5):\n- **Offer**: [2, 3, 3, 2, 0] (I keep the rest)\n  - I keep:\n    - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n    - 1 unit of item 2 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n    - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n    - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 56 = 168\n  - Total value to me = 0 + 24 + 24 + 7 + 168 = 223\n\nThis offer is not better than my outside offer of 400. Therefore, I should try a different approach to retain more of the valuable items:\n\n**Refined Potential Counteroffer**:\n- **Offer**: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n  - I keep:\n    - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n    - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n    - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 56 = 112\n  - Total value to me = 28 + 72 + 72 + 14 + 112 = 298\n\nEven the refined offer is still significantly lower than my outside offer of 400, but it is much closer and a reasonable attempt to maximize my value.\n\n**Decision**:\nBased on my calculations, my previous refined offer is the best potential opportunity to negotiate while still trying not to significantly drop my current position.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    60 x 0 + 37 x 3 + 10 x 1 + 26 x 2 + 69 x 3\n    which is 380 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 381. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 2, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If I wait until round 3, it will be discounted by gamma (0.98).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n\n   - **Current Offer: [0, 0, 3, 2, 1]**\n     - My value calculation:\n       - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n       - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 24 = 0\n       - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 24 = 72\n       - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 7 = 14\n       - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n     - Total Value = 72 + 14 + 56 = 142\n\n   - **Compare to Outside Offer:**\n     - Current offer total value (142) is significantly less than my outside offer value (400).\n\n3) **Make a Decision:**\n   - **ACCEPT:** Not advisable since 142 is much lower than 400.\n   - **WALK:** It\u2019s a guaranteed 400, which is more than the current offer of 142. Walking away is rational if no counteroffer can improve the situation.\n   - **COUNTEROFFER:** A counteroffer should provide me with a value greater than 400 to be considered.\n\nGiven that the discount factor will reduce the effectiveness of any counteroffer should we reach round 3, I should either aim to strike a deal now with a favorable counteroffer or prepare to walk away.\n\nConstructing a counteroffer:\n- Let's aim for items with the highest values. Item 3 and item 5 have relatively higher values to me. I aim to receive:\n  - 2 units of item 1\n  - 2 units of item 2\n  - 1 unit of item 3\n  - 1 unit of item 4\n  - 1 unit of item 5\n- Value for this division:\n  - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 14 = 28\n  - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 24 = 48\n  - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 24 = 24\n  - 1 unit of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 7 = 7\n  - 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 56 = 56\n  - Total Value = 28 + 48 + 24 + 7 + 56 = 163, which is still not greater than 400 but improves my value compared to the current offer.\n\nCounteroffer breakdown:\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 will be:\n- [0, 2, 3, 2, 2]\nThis means Player 1 gets 0 of item 1, 2 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 2 of item 4, and 2 of item 5.\n\nHowever, it's critical to remember the key mistake not to make an offer worse for myself than my outside offer of 400. \n\nSo my final decision is:\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 1, 1, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 45 x 4 + 31 x 1 + 78 x 1 + 76 x 6\n    which is 745 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 746. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Since we are in round 1, there is no reduction in value yet, but by round 2, any outcome would be worth 0.98 times the evaluated value, and by round 3, it would be 0.98^2 times the evaluated value.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\nThere is no current offer on the table, so I need to make an initial offer.\n\nLet's consider the total value of all items:\n- Item 1: 2 * 49 = 98\n- Item 2: 7 * 45 = 315\n- Item 3: 3 * 31 = 93\n- Item 4: 1 * 78 = 78\n- Item 5: 6 * 76 = 456\n- **Total Value** = 1040\n\nTo avoid mistake 2 (making an offer worse for me than my outside offer), I must ensure that my retained total is at least 746.\n\nLet's propose an offer and analyze its value. I will start by proposing that I keep fractions of items while ensuring my total value is greater than or equal to my outside offer of 746.\n\n### Potential Initial Offer:\nI'll consider a division where I aim to cover my outside offer value efficiently without being too aggressive initially.\n\nLet's say I want to keep:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (value: 49 * 1 = 49)\n- 5 units of Item 2 (value: 45 * 5 = 225)\n- 1 unit of Item 3 (value: 31 * 1 = 31)\n- 1 unit of Item 4 (value: 78 * 1 = 78)\n- 4 units of Item 5 (value: 76 * 4 = 304)\n\n**Value to me**: 49 + 225 + 31 + 78 + 304 = 687\n\n687 is less than my outside offer, so I need to adjust to increase my kept value. I'll adjust my proposed retained units:\n\nRevised proposal:\n- 1 unit of Item 1 (value: 49 * 1 = 49)\n- 5 units of Item 2 (value: 45 * 4 = 180)\n- 2 units of Item 3 (value: 31 * 2 = 62)\n- 1 unit of Item 4 (value: 78 * 1 = 78)\n- 6 units of Item 5 (value: 76 * 6 = 456)\n\n**Value to me**: 49 + 180 + 62 + 78 + 456 = 825\n\n825 is better than my outside offer of 746, so this proposal is valid and beneficial.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\nI will propose a counteroffer where I give Player 2:\n- 1 unit of Item 1\n- 2 units of Item 2\n- 1 unit of Item 3\n- 0 units of Item 4\n- 0 units of Item 5\n\nThis keeps my total value above my outside offer and complies with the guidelines to make profitable decisions.\n\nMy action:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 2, 1, 0, 0]}\n```",

Since we are in round 1, this does not affect the current decision, but it factors into how much future offers are worth compared to immediate acceptance.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer [1, 2, 1, 0, 0] (the amount of each item being offered to me):**\n  - 1 unit of Item 1 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n  - 2 units of Item 2 = 2 \u00d7 72 = 144\n  - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n  - 0 units of Item 4 = 0 \u00d7 46 = 0\n  - 0 units of Item 5 = 0 \u00d7 47 = 0\n  - **Total value to me = 22 + 144 + 8 = 174**\n\nSince 174 is less than my outside offer value of 571, accepting this offer is not preferable.\n\n- **Potential counteroffers** need to be considered for their total value to me without making any of the mistakes:\n  1.

Let's try to compute a counteroffer that gives me a value higher than 571, keeping Player 1 interested.\n\n### Counteroffer Proposal:\n\nLet's consider a division offering more items to me, particularly focusing on high-value items.\n\nGiven the previous offer from Player 1, try optimizing without too much deviation:\n\n- Offer Player 1: [1, 4, 2, 1, 2].

This means that the value of a deal decreases slightly with each round, so earlier agreements are more valuable.\n\n2) **Assess the value of offers:**\n   - Currently, no offer is on the table. As the first player, I need to propose an initial offer.\n   - I will consider potential counteroffers and ensure that any offer I propose gives me a value greater than my outside offer of 357.\n\n3) **Decision:**\n   - I need to construct an offer where the total value to me is greater than 357. I want to maximize my payoff while considering that Player 2 can reject my offers.\n\nTo avoid mistakes, here's a potential offer where I keep items with a high value for me and offer less valuable items to Player 2:\n\nLet's calculate a counteroffer:\n- I will keep a majority of high-value items and offer Player 2 some of the items that are less crucial to my total value.\n\n   Keep:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 66 = 264\n   - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 92 = 368\n   - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 2 = 2\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 81 = 243\n   - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n\n   Total value to me: 264 + 368 + 2 + 243 + 92 = 969. This is significantly greater than my outside offer of 357.\n\nBased on this analysis, here is my action:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```\n\nThis configuration ensures a total value to me greater than my outside offer, and it leaves room for negotiation while providing Player 2 with a substantial portion of the items.",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

This means that waiting longer to close a deal will slightly reduce the present value of the deal due to this discounting effect.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n#### Current Offer:\nThe current offer from Player 1 is [2, 1, 1, 2, 2]. Let's calculate the total value of this offer:\n\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 79 = 158\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 89 = 89\n- 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 92 = 92\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 89 = 178\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n\n**Total value of the current offer** = 158 + 89 + 92 + 178 + 12 = 529\n\n- Since we are in Round 1, the value is not discounted yet (as \\(\\gamma^{0} = 1\\)).\n\n**Comparison with Outside Offer**: \n- Current offer value = 529\n- Outside offer value = 329\n\nThe current offer is clearly better than my outside offer of 329.\n\n#### Potential Counteroffers:\nTo propose a counteroffer better than my outside offer and acceptable to Player 1, I must evaluate proposals that result in me retaining a total value significantly higher than 329 and hopefully higher than 529 over time due to discounting if rejection occurs.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nGiven that the current offer's value (529) is already superior to my outside offer (329), and considering the discount factor could reduce future offer values, the smart decision is to accept the bargain on the table. Rejecting the current offer and possibly insisting on more without knowing Player 1's circumstances and constraints, while factoring in the discount, could jeopardize my advantage.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n  \n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer.

The negotiation is currently in round 2, so any delay until round 3 would have a discount factor of 0.98.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer [0, 0, 0, 1, 3]**:\n  - Value to you:\n    - Item 4: 1 x 41 = 41\n    - Item 5: 3 x 34 = 102\n    - Total Value = 41 + 102 = 143\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**:\n  We need to ensure any counteroffer provides a value above your outside offer (36) and is reasonable for Player 2 to consider.\n\n  For instance, let's calculate the value if you offer [1, 0, 1, 1, 3], keeping [2, 0, 0, 1, 3] for yourself:\n  - Item 1: 2 x 39 = 78\n  - Item 3: 0 x 1 = 0\n  - Item 4: 1 x 41 = 41\n  - Item 5: 3 x 34 = 102\n  - Total Value = 78 + 0 + 41 + 102 = 221\n\n  This would yield a value of 221 to you, which is well above your outside offer and better than the current offer.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n\nSince the current offer's value (143) is much higher than your outside offer (36), accepting the current offer is beneficial. Walking away would result in only receiving your outside offer value of 36, which is significantly lower.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 269. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 92 = 276 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 71 = 213 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 1176 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 3, 4, 3, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 3, 4, 3, 2]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",

This factor means the value of any negotiated outcome will be multiplied by \\( \\gamma^{(r-1)} \\) depending on the round in which the agreement is reached. For the current round (round 1), the discount factor is 1 (since \\( 0^{th} \\) power of 0.98 is 1).\n\n2) **Assess the Value of Offers:**\n   - Current offer: [1, 3, 4, 3, 2].\n     - My value calculation if I accept the current offer:\n       - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 61 = 61\n       - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 71 = 213\n       - Item 3: 4 units \u00d7 97 = 388\n       - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 92 = 276\n       - Item 5: 2 units \u00d7 71 = 142\n     - Total value from accepting this offer: \\( 61 + 213 + 388 + 276 + 142 = 1080 \\).\n   - Since the current offer value (1080) is significantly greater than my outside offer (269), it is an attractive offer.\n\n3) **Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:**\n   - Compare the value of accepting the current offer (1080) to the outside offer (269). The current offer is much better than the outside offer.\n   - According to Mistake 5, walking away from a better offer than the outside offer is a mistake. Hence, it's logical to accept this offer.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most rational decision is:\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items.

Therefore, I must consider the discounted value when deciding to wait for future offers.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **Current offer on the table ([2, 1, 3, 1, 3]):**\n  - Value = (2 \u00d7 25) + (1 \u00d7 31) + (3 \u00d7 57) + (1 \u00d7 85) + (3 \u00d7 51)\n  - Value = 50 + 31 + 171 + 85 + 153\n  - Total value = 490\n\n- Since we're in round 2, apply the discount factor:\n  - Discounted value = 490 \u00d7 0.98 = 480.2\n\n- **Comparison to my outside offer:**\n  - The discounted current offer value (480.2) is less than my outside offer value (544).\n\n### 3) Make a decision:\n\n- **Accept the current offer?**\n  - No, because the discounted value (480.2) is less than my outside offer (544).\n\n- **Walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  - Not immediately, because I may still negotiate a better offer in the next round.\n\n### Consider Counteroffer Options:\n\n- A counteroffer must be better for me than my outside offer (544) when discounted for one more round (applying a 0.98 discount factor).

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 71. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 90 = 270 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 96 x 0 + 90 x 0 + 30 x 0 + 41 x 0\n    which is 62 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 71. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "To determine the best action, let's analyze the current situation and assess potential offers as per the given steps:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n- **Outside Offer Value**: 71\n- **Values of the Items**:\n  - Item 1: 62 per unit\n  - Item 2: 96 per unit\n  - Item 3: 90 per unit\n  - Item 4: 30 per unit\n  - Item 5: 41 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 4 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 2 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 5 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor of 0.98 means if the deal is reached in later rounds, the value is slightly reduced.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\nAs there is no current offer on the table, we need to propose an initial offer. Let's evaluate several potential counteroffers:\n\n1. **Offer 1: Keeping 3 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5** (leaving 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 for Player 2):\n\n   - Value to me:\n     - 3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186\n     - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 96 = 288\n     - 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 90 = 90\n     - 3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 30 = 90\n     - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123\n   - Total value = 186 + 288 + 90 + 90 + 123 = 777\n    \n   This value (777) is much higher than the outside offer of 71.\n\n2. **Offer 2: Keeping 2 units of each item** (leaving 2 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 3 units of item 5 for Player 2):\n   \n   - Value to me:\n     - 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 62 = 124\n     - 2 units of item 2 = 2 \u00d7 96 = 192\n     - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 90 = 180\n     - 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 30 = 60\n     - 2 units of item 5 = 2 \u00d7 41 = 82\n   - Total value = 124 + 192 + 180 + 60 + 82 = 638\n\n   This value (638) is also much higher than the outside offer of 71.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nSince there is no current offer from Player 2 and both of the assessments above yield higher values than the outside offer, I will propose an initial offer trying to maximize my payoff. Given the values calculated, it makes sense to start with a slightly aggressive offer that leaves room for negotiation.\n\n**Proposed Offer**: Offer Player 2 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 1 unit of item 3, 2 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nThis translates to keeping:\n- 3 units of item 1\n- 3 units of item 2\n- 1 unit of item 3\n- 3 units of item 4\n- 3 units of item 5\n\nThis proposal provides me with a value of 777, which is significantly higher than my outside offer.\n\nFinal decision:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]}\n```",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 7, 5, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    10 x 2 + 27 x 7 + 47 x 5 + 16 x 2 + 34 x 1\n    which is 510 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 511. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

Since it is round 1, the current present value for a negotiation agreement occurs after this round will have minimal influence due to gamma^0 = 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer (if any):** None yet, as we have to make the initial offer.\n- **Potential Counteroffers/Initial Offer:**\n  - Let's evaluate what set of items I should retain to ensure the total is better than my outside offer value of 511.\n\nLet's start by calculating my value for retaining all items:\n- Total value of all items to me:\n  - Item 1: 3 \u00d7 10 = 30\n  - Item 2: 8 \u00d7 27 = 216\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Item 4: 3 \u00d7 16 = 48\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n  - Total value = 30 + 216 + 235 + 48 + 34 = 563\n\nTo ensure a value higher than my outside offer:\n- Retain items such that their value is greater than 511.\n  \nOne strategy is to retain the items or combinations yielding maximum total values:\n\nIf we start with:\n- Retaining all units of each item:\n  - Total value is 563, which is obviously more than 511.\n  \nGiven that 563 is comfortably more than 511, I can create offers to Player 2 by offering some of the least valuable items first.\n\nLet's propose an initial equitable offer:\n- I will keep more units of the higher-valued items to me and offer the lesser value items. Balancing this way, I ensure a likely acceptance since Player 2 will also value some of these items potentially higher.\n\n**Offer to Player 2:**\n- Item 1: Offer 1 unit (keeping 2)\n- Item 2: Offer 3 units (keeping 5)\n- Item 3: Offer 0 units (keeping all 5)\n- Item 4: Offer 1 unit (keeping 2)\n- Item 5: Offer 1 units (keeping 0)\n\nMy Value Calculation if this is accepted:\n- For Player 1 (myself): \n  - Item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - Item 2: 5 \u00d7 27 = 135\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Item 4: 2 \u00d7 16 = 32\n  - Item 5: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n  - Total: 20 + 135 + 235 + 32 = 422\n\n422 is below my outside offer, thus I will need to enhance this situation further.\n  \nI can improve the initial situation by retaining all of Item 5 since it carries a significant value of 34 itself.\n\nA revised offer might consist of Player 1 keeping slightly more of higher valuable items like Item 2 and 3:\n\nRevised Offer:\n  - Item 1: Offer 1 unit (keeping 2)\n  - Item 2: Offer 4 units (keeping 4)\n  - Item 3: Offer 0 units (keeping all 5)\n  - Item 4: Offer 3 units (keeping 0)\n  - Item 5: Offer 1 units (keeping 0)\n\nRecalculate My Value:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 27 = 108\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 16 = 0\n- Item 5: 0 \u00d7 34 = 0\n- New Total: 20 + 108 + 235 = 363\n\nThis is still below the outside offer so let's solidify the strong position:\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\nAs my revised offer still isn't surpassing my outside offer, a better counter yet implies the bare minimum:\n**Another pivotal necessity involves holding all Item 5, given its notable value of 34.**\n\nUltimately, the final consideration in achieving the right course involves better rerunning the situation symbolic value alignment. Here's an enhanced proposed strategy:\n\nNew Attempt Offer, Realigned:\n- Item 1: Offer 2 units (keeping 1)\n- Item 2: Offer 2 units (keeping 6)\n- Item 3: Offer 0 unit (keeping 5)\n- Item 4: Offer 2 units (keeping 1)\n- Item 5: Offer 0 units (keeping 1)\n\nThis proposed deal amounts in my re-evaluation:\n- Final Value for Self:\n  - Item 1: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - Item 2: 6 \u00d7 27 = 162\n  - Item 3: 5 \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Item 4: 1 \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - Item 5: 1 \u00d7 34 = 34\n- New Grand Total: 10 + 162 + 235 + 16 + 34 = 457\n\nA counteroffer of this specificity favors clearer approach focusing distinct intent:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 2, 0]}",

If I accept the current offer this round, its value isn't discounted because it applies after concluding another round.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the value of offers\n\n**Current offer on the table:** [1, 3, 0, 1, 0] (offered to me, thus Player 2 keeps [2, 5, 5, 2, 1])\n\n- Value to me if I accept the current offer:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - Item 2: 3 units \u00d7 27 = 81\n  - Item 3: 0 units \u00d7 47 = 0\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 34 = 0\n  - **Total value to me:** 10 + 81 + 0 + 16 + 0 = 107\n\n**Comparison to my outside offer:** My outside offer is 511, which is significantly higher than 107, the total value of accepting the current offer.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n\n1. **Accept the current offer:** The total value is 107, which is worse than my outside offer of 511, failing Mistake 4.\n  \n2. **Walk away:** Given my outside offer is 511, walking away remains a robust option if no better offers emerge.\n   \n3. **Propose a counteroffer:** I should test possible divisions that at least match or exceed my outside offer.\n\nLet me propose a counteroffer to maximize my outcome:\n\nTo ensure the offer I make is at least as good as my outside offer, let's attempt the maximum possible value close to or more than 511. \n\nLet's propose keeping all units of item 3 (5 units) due to their high value and see if we can offer worthy items to Player 2: \n\n- Propose to keep: [1, 4, 5, 1, 0]\n  Meaning, offer to Player 2: [2, 4, 0, 2, 1]\n  \n- Total value keeping these items:\n  - Item 1: 1 unit \u00d7 10 = 10\n  - Item 2: 4 units \u00d7 27 = 108\n  - Item 3: 5 units \u00d7 47 = 235\n  - Item 4: 1 unit \u00d7 16 = 16\n  - Item 5: 0 units \u00d7 34 = 0\n  - **Total value achieving for me is 369** which is still less than my outside offer.\n\nUpon reassessment, maximizing items' value seems almost impossible to match 511 without denying virtually all to them. Given these constraints and after verifying more configurations still keeping values low:\n\nThe highest effective move preserving my baseline best course is constitutional, that\u2019s walking away. \n\nAs a result:\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 1 x 5 + 36 x 1 + 54 x 3\n    which is 208 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 209. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

However, it will start reducing the value received as rounds increase.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer**: No current offer on the table.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division that at least meets or ideally exceeds my outside offer value of 209.\n\nLet's calculate some potential offers to ensure they surpass the outside offer:\n\n1. Keeping all items to myself (to check total max value):\n   - Value = (1 * 5) + (3 * 18) + (8 * 1) + (5 * 36) + (4 * 54) = 463.\n\n2. Try an offer where I keep a valuable portion (attempt to surpass 209):\n   - Proposal: I keep [0, 2, 6, 3, 2] and offer [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] to Player 2.\n   - My total value = (0 * 5) + (2 * 18) + (6 * 1) + (3 * 36) + (2 * 54) = 318, which is above 209.\n\n### Decision Making\n- The value for what I keep with the proposal [1, 1, 2, 2, 2] to Player 2 translates to me keeping [0, 2, 6, 3, 2], which is worth 318 to me.\n- This value of 318 is greater than my outside offer value of 209. \n- There is no risk of making the highlighted mistakes, as the proposed value exceeds my outside fallback, and there are ample rounds remaining to negotiate if not accepted.\n\nThus, I will make the following counteroffer: \n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 5, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 1 + 18 x 0 + 1 x 5 + 36 x 1 + 54 x 3\n    which is 208 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 209. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 2, 2, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

If the process extends into future rounds, the total value of the negotiation will decrease.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n- **Current Offer (offered to me): [0, 2, 3, 2, 1]**\n  - My Value if Accepted: \n    - Item 1: 0 x 5 = 0\n    - Item 2: 2 x 18 = 36\n    - Item 3: 3 x 1 = 3\n    - Item 4: 2 x 36 = 72\n    - Item 5: 1 x 54 = 54\n  - Total Value: \\( 0 + 36 + 3 + 72 + 54 = 165 \\)\n  - Adjust for Discount: \\( 165 \\times 0.98 = 161.7 \\), which is less than the outside offer of 209.\n\n- **Evaluate Potential Counteroffer:**\n  - My goal must be to propose an offer where my value is greater than 209.\n\n#### Example Calculation:\n- Let's assume offering [0, 1, 6, 2, 2]:\n  - Resulting Items for me: [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]\n  - My Value: \n    - Item 1: 1 x 5 = 5\n    - Item 2: 2 x 18 = 36\n    - Item 3: 2 x 1 = 2\n    - Item 4: 3 x 36 = 108\n    - Item 5: 2 x 54 = 108\n  - Total Value: \\( 5 + 36 + 2 + 108 + 108 = 259 \\), which is more than 209, even when applying discounts.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- Since accepting the current offer is worse than my outside offer, I should not accept it.\n- Walking is not ideal because we can achieve a better distribution.\n- Propose a balanced counteroffer that assures bargaining payoff advantages over my fallback position.\n\n### Action\nI will make a COUNTEROFFER where I value items more strategically.

Thus, I need to retain more value.\n\n**Offer Evaluation: Propose an offer [2, 1, 0, 1, 1]:**\n- My items kept:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 3 = 6\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 45 = 45\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 73 = 146\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 4 = 8\n  - 4 units of item 5: 4 x 58 = 232\n\n- Total Value = 6 + 45 + 146 + 8 + 232 = 437\n\nStill less than 464.\n\nI continue proposing until I ensure my value is above my outside offer:\n\n**Potential Offer: Propose [2, 1, 1, 1, 0]:**\n- My items kept:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 3 = 6\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 45 = 45\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 73 = 73\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 4 = 8\n  - 5 units of item 5: 5 x 58 = 290\n\n- Total Value = 6 + 45 + 73 + 8 + 290 = 422\n\nAgain, this is less than my outside offer. I'll iterate until I find the acceptable point:\n\n**Offer Evaluation: Final Proposal: [2, 1, 1, 0, 0]:**\n- My items kept:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 x 3 = 6\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 45 = 45\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 x 73 = 73\n  - 3 units of item 4: 3 x 4 = 12\n  - 5 units of item 5: 5 x 58 = 290\n\n- Total Value = 6 + 45 + 73 + 12 + 290 = 426\n\nThis offer value is still less than my outside offer. \n\nContinue to strategize, each iteration finding a better balance. Once ensuring better offer than outside possibilities:\n\n**Offer: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]**\n\n- My items kept:\n  - 3 units of item 1: 3 x 3 = 9\n  - 1 unit of item 2: 1 x 45 = 45\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 x 73 = 146\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 x 4 = 8\n  - 4 units of item 5: 4 x 58 = 232\n\n- Total Value = 9 + 45 + 146 + 8 + 232 = 510\n\nSince 510 is more than my outside offer of 464, this offer is acceptable.\n\n### 3) Decision:\nThe goal is to make an offer securing a value higher than the fall-back position:\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]}",

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Accepting a reasonable offer earlier might be beneficial if the discounted values later are not significantly higher.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer [1, 1, 0, 1, 1]**\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 35 = 35\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 52 = 52\n  - Value of 0 unit of item 3: 0 \u00d7 81 = 0\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 46 = 46\n  - Value of 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 12 = 12\n  - Total Value of Current Offer = 35 + 52 + 0 + 46 + 12 = 145\n\nSince 145 is greater than my outside offer of 116, the current offer, if accepted, would be beneficial compared to walking away.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\n- **Should I Accept the Current Offer?** Yes, because the value of 145 exceeds my outside offer of 116. It is a better deal than walking away.\n- **Should I Walk?** No, given my outside offer is less than the current offer, walking would be a mistake.\n- **Should I Make a Counteroffer?** A counteroffer could aim for a higher value, but it risks the decrease in value due to discounting in future rounds. The current offer already exceeds the outside offer by 29, so accepting it avoids any risk and ensures I receive this value immediately without further negotiation-induced depreciation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the optimal decision is to:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 70 x 1 + 48 x 0 + 83 x 4 + 6 x 2\n    which is 414 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 415. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "Let's go through the step-by-step analysis to decide on the action:\n\n1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n   - My outside offer value is 1141.\n   - My private values for the items are:\n     - Item 1: 43\n     - Item 2: 80\n     - Item 3: 22\n     - Item 4: 80\n     - Item 5: 64\n   - The total pool of items is:\n     - 5 units of Item 1\n     - 8 units of Item 2\n     - 2 units of Item 3\n     - 4 units of Item 4\n     - 6 units of Item 5\n   - The discount factor influences the present value of future rounds. In this round, gamma is 0.98^0 = 1, but in round 2 it would be 0.98^1 = 0.98, reducing the effective value of any negotiated agreement by 2%.\n\n2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n   - Current offer from Player 1: [3, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n     - 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n     - 3 units of Item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n     - 1 unit of Item 3 = 1 \u00d7 22 = 22\n     - 2 units of Item 4 = 2 \u00d7 80 = 160\n     - 3 units of Item 5 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192\n     - Total value of current offer to me = 129 + 240 + 22 + 160 + 192 = 743\n\n   - Compare this to my outside offer of 1141. The current offer is significantly lower than my outside offer value.\n\n3) Make a decision:\n\n   - Accepting the current offer gives me only 743, which is less than my outside offer value of 1141. So, accepting would be a mistake 4.\n   - Walking away guarantees me 1141. Since the current offer is lower than my outside offer, walking away is better than accepting the current offer.\n   - I can make a counteroffer, but it must be an offer that ensures I get a value higher than 1141, given the distribution of items and my value per unit.\n\nLet's propose a counteroffer that better maximizes my outcome. I can start by aiming to get more of the high-value items:\n\nPossible counteroffer by retaining more of the items valuable to me:\n- Offer Player 1: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2] (I keep [3, 6, 2, 3, 4])\n\nLet's compute my value for this counteroffer:\n- 3 units of Item 1 = 3 \u00d7 43 = 129\n- 6 units of Item 2 = 6 \u00d7 80 = 480\n- 2 units of Item 3 = 2 \u00d7 22 = 44\n- 3 units of Item 4 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240\n- 4 units of Item 5 = 4 \u00d7 64 = 256\n- Total value of this counteroffer to me = 129 + 480 + 44 + 240 + 256 = 1149\n\nThis value (1149) is greater than my outside offer (1141).\n\nThus, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 70 x 1 + 48 x 0 + 83 x 4 + 6 x 2\n    which is 414 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 415. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 415. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 2 = 6 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 70 = 210 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 48 = 144 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 627 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.98, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 0, 4, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    2 x 0 + 70 x 1 + 48 x 0 + 83 x 4 + 6 x 2\n    which is 414 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 415. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 3, 1, 2, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 2, 0, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 1, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the best action, let's walk through the questions step-by-step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **Outside Offer Value:** My outside offer value is 302.\n\n- **Item Values:** My private values per unit are:\n  - Item 1: 62\n  - Item 2: 48\n  - Item 3: 39\n  - Item 4: 94\n  - Item 5: 18\n\n- **Total Pool of Items:** There are 6 units of item 1, 2 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, and 6 units of item 5.\n\n- **Discount Factor Influence:** The discount factor, \u03b3 = 0.98, reduces the effective value over rounds due to the delay. Hence, it encourages not to delay a beneficial deal too much, as values will be multiplied by a decreasing factor in subsequent rounds.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current Offer Value:**\n  - Item 1: 2 units * 62 = 124\n  - Item 2: 1 unit * 48 = 48\n  - Item 3: 0 units * 39 = 0\n  - Item 4: 5 units * 94 = 470\n  - Item 5: 0 units * 18 = 0\n  - Total = 124 + 48 + 0 + 470 + 0 = 642\n\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer:** The current offer is worth 642, which is significantly higher than my outside offer of 302. Thus, accepting the current offer would be advantageous as it provides a much higher value than my fallback position.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers:**\n  - I need to ensure any counteroffer is worth more than 302 and ideally more than 642, the current offer's value.\n  - Consider how much value I could keep for myself if I were to propose different distributions.\n\n### 3) Make a Decision Based on the Analysis:\n\nConsidering that accepting the current offer gives me a value of 642, which is substantially higher than my outside offer value of 302, and given that it meets my objective of maximizing my payoff without making negotiation mistakes, accepting the offer right now seems to be the best course of action. The high value it provides outweighs any deterioration of value from the discount factor and assures a better outcome than walking away.\n\nTherefore, my action is:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 1, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 60 x 2 + 56 x 1 + 100 x 1 + 27 x 2\n    which is 330 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 331. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.
