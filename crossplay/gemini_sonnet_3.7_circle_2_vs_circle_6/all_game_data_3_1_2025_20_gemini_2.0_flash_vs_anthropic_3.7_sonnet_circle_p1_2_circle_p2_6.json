This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 87 x 6 + 46 x 5 + 57 x 4 + 40 x 1\n    which is 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1021. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 3, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1021. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 87 = 261 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 46 = 138 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 57 = 171 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 702 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 6, 5, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    4 x 0 + 87 x 6 + 46 x 5 + 57 x 4 + 40 x 1\n    which is 1020 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1021. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 3, 2, 3, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

I don't know their values, so I'll start by making a fairly generous offer, trying to gauge their reaction. I will offer them half of each item.

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 612. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 612. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 68 = 204 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 53 = 159 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 55 = 165 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 741 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    68 x 2 + 52 x 2 + 19 x 2 + 53 x 2 + 55 x 4\n    which is 604 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 612. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 1, 1, 2]\n\n    What is your action?

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [5, 3, 4, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 5 + 49 x 3 + 20 x 4 + 19 x 3 + 17 x 7\n    which is 428 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 433. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 1, 2, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze this offer carefully and decide whether to accept, walk away, or make a counteroffer.\n\n## 1) Current Situation Analysis:\n- My outside offer value: 433\n- My item values: 5 for item 1, 49 for item 2, 20 for item 3, 19 for item 4, 17 for item 5\n- Total pool: 7 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n- Discount factor: \u03b3 = 0.9 (reduces value by 10% each round)\n\n## 2) Value Assessment:\n\n### Current offer value to me:\nPlayer 1 offered [3, 1, 2, 1, 3], meaning I would get:\n- 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 5 = 15\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 49 = 49\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n- 1 unit of item 4: 1 \u00d7 19 = 19\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\nTotal value: 174\n\nThis is much less than my outside offer of 433, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n### What would I keep with this offer:\nI'd keep [4, 2, 2, 2, 4] which values:\n- 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 5 = 20\n- 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 49 = 98\n- 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 20 = 40\n- 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 19 = 38\n- 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 17 = 68\nTotal value: 264\n\nStill less than my outside offer.\n\n### Potential counteroffer:\nLet me try keeping more of the high-value items. Item 2 is most valuable to me (49), followed by item 3 (20), item 4 (19), and item 5 (17). Item 1 has low value (5).\n\nIf I keep all of item 2 (3 units), all of item 3 (4 units), all of item 4 (3 units), and 3 units of item 5, and offer Player 1 all of item 1 (7 units) and 4 units of item 5:\n\nMy value would be:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 17 = 51\nTotal value: 335\n\nThat's still below my outside offer of 433. I need to keep more items.\n\nLet me try keeping all of the items except item 1:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 403\n\nStill below my outside offer. Since item 1 has very low value for me, I'll offer all of that, but I need to keep most of everything else to exceed my outside offer.\n\nLet me try keeping everything except item 1:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 403\n\nThis is still below my outside offer. I need to keep some of item 1 as well.\n\nIf I keep 1 unit of item 1 and everything else:\n- 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 408\n\nStill below outside offer. Let me try keeping 2 units of item 1:\n\n- 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 5 = 10\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 413\n\nStill below. Let me try keeping 6 units of item 1:\n\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 433\n\nThis matches my outside offer exactly. If I keep 7 units of item 1, I'll exceed it:\n\n- 7 units of item 1: 7 \u00d7 5 = 35\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 438\n\n## 3) Decision:\nThe current offer gives me a value of only 174, which is much less than my outside offer of 433.\n\nI need to make a counteroffer. Since we're still in round 1, I should make a reasonable counteroffer that still gives me value above my outside offer.\n\nLet me offer 1 unit of item 1 to Player 1 and keep the rest for myself. This would be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] as my counteroffer, meaning I give Player 1 1 unit of item 1 and keep everything else.\n\nMy value would be:\n- 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 5 = 30\n- 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n- 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 19 = 57\n- 7 units of item 5: 7 \u00d7 17 = 119\nTotal value: 433\n\nThis matches my outside offer exactly.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer of 229 and the discount factor of 0.9.\n\nMy values are: item 1: 61, item 2: 20, item 3: 67, item 4: 17, item 5: 25. Total value = 61 + 20 + 4*67 + 0*17 + 2*25 = 61 + 20 + 268 + 0 + 50 = 399.\n\nI should start by considering what a \"fair\" split might look like. Since I don't know Player 2's values, I'll assume they value the items somewhat similarly to me. Let's aim for a split where both players get roughly half the total value, taking into account the limited number of items. So approximately 399/2 = ~200 for me and ~200 for player 2.\n\nIf I keep all the items for myself I get 399. If I give everything to Player 2 I get 0. I also have the outside offer of 229, which means I should not settle for anything below that.\n\nLet's consider an offer where I give Player 2:\n*   1 unit of item 1\n*   1 unit of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nThis means I keep:\n*   0 unit of item 1\n*   0 unit of item 2\n*   2 units of item 3\n*   0 units of item 4\n*   1 unit of item 5\n\nValue to Player 2: 1*61 + 1*20 + 2*67 + 0*17 + 1*25 = 61 + 20 + 134 + 0 + 25 = 240\nValue to me: 2*67 + 1*25 = 134+25 = 159\n\nThis split seems beneficial to Player 2 and would probably not be accepted.\nI need to give away less.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    5 x 0 + 72 x 1 + 48 x 4 + 20 x 0 + 60 x 2\n    which is 384 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 386. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I need to keep more items to make it worthwhile.\n\nSince there are only 8 total items (1+1+4+0+2), and my values for items 2, 3, and 5 are relatively high, I would ideally keep most of those.\n\nLet me try offering only [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1 (keeping everything else):\n\nValue to me of what I keep:\n- 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 5 = 0\n- 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 72 = 72\n- 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 48 = 192\n- 0 units of item 4: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n- 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 60 = 120\nTotal: 384\n\nThis is still slightly below my outside offer of 386.\n\nLet me try one more option - if I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] to Player 1 (keeping everything):\nValue to me: 5 + 72 + 192 + 0 + 120 = 389\n\nThis exceeds my outside offer value, but might be too aggressive as an opening offer.\n\n## 4. Decision\n\nGiven that Player 1's initial offer was extremely low-value to me (48 vs. my outside offer of 386), and even fairly generous offers from me would still be below my outside offer value, I'll make a counteroffer that keeps the most valuable items for me.\n\nI'll offer Player 1 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] - giving them only the item I value least (item 1).\n\nValue of this offer to me: 72 + 192 + 120 = 384, which is very close to my outside offer of 386.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 229. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player, player2, 2 units of each item (keeping 1 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 61 = 183 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 67 = 201 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 17 = 51 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 570 (sum of all item values)\n\n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation and determine the optimal action for Player 1 in round 2.\n\nCurrent offer to me: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means Player 2 is offering me 1 unit of item 1, 0 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 0 units of item 5.\n\nMy values are:\n- Item 1: 61\n- Item 2: 20\n- Item 3: 67\n- Item 4: 17\n- Item 5: 25\n\nValue of the current offer: (1 * 61) + (0 * 20) + (0 * 67) + (0 * 17) + (0 * 25) = 61\n\nDiscounted value of accepting the current offer: 61 * 0.9^(2-1) = 61 * 0.9 = 54.9\n\nMy outside offer: 229\n\nSince 54.9 < 229, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to offer Player 2 enough to make them accept. It's the second round, so I need to consider the discount factor. I have the following items: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 4 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5.\n\nThe initial offer in round 1 was [0, 0, 1, 0, 0], which is not good for me. Player 2 responded with [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. My outside offer is 229, which is quite high.\n\nI can try to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me than my outside option and that Player 2 might accept. A possible reasonable offer I can offer to Player 2 might be giving up more of item 3 and 5.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 1].\nThis means I keep: 1 unit of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 2 units of item 3, 0 units of item 4, 1 units of item 5.\n\nMy value: (1 * 61) + (1 * 20) + (2 * 67) + (0 * 17) + (1 * 25) = 61 + 20 + 134 + 0 + 25 = 240\n\nDiscounted value: 240 * 0.9 = 216\n\nEven with the discount factor, the new offer gives me 216, which is less than my outside offer of 229. So that offer isn't better than walking away.\n\nHow about I offer nothing? [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nThis gives me:\n(1 * 61) + (1 * 20) + (4 * 67) + (0 * 17) + (2 * 25) = 61 + 20 + 268 + 0 + 50 = 399\nDiscounted: 399 * 0.9 = 359.1.\n\nHowever, the counteroffer will be rejected.\n\nLet's propose an offer that extracts maximum surplus:\n\nI give [0, 1, 4, 0, 2]. That means I keep item 1. This is worth 61. Discounted, 61 * 0.9 = 54.9. Clearly walking away is better.\n\nSince it is round 2, and none of the offers is profitable for me with the discount factor considered, it is better to walk away.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 1, 3, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    89 x 0 + 92 x 0 + 78 x 1 + 18 x 3 + 19 x 3\n    which is 189 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 192. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [2, 4, 1, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

My goal is to maximize my value, considering my private values for each item and my outside offer of 387.\n\nMy values for the items are:\n- Item 1: 7\n- Item 2: 95\n- Item 3: 77\n- Item 4: 52\n- Item 5: 62\n\nThe total number of items are:\n- Item 1: 3\n- Item 2: 4\n- Item 3: 9\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 6\n\nLet's calculate my total value if I get all the items:\n- Item 1: 3 * 7 = 21\n- Item 2: 4 * 95 = 380\n- Item 3: 9 * 77 = 693\n- Item 4: 1 * 52 = 52\n- Item 5: 6 * 62 = 372\nTotal value = 21 + 380 + 693 + 52 + 372 = 1518\n\nSince there is no current offer and this is the first round, I need to decide on an initial offer. I need to offer Player 2 some items to entice them to accept a deal that is better than their outside option but also beneficial for me compared to my outside option (387).\n\nA simple initial strategy is to offer Player 2 a 50/50 split of the total value. However, a direct 50/50 item split is not possible due to the different quantities of each item.  Instead, I should focus on offering Player 2 more of the items I value less and keeping more of the items I value higher.\nI'll start by offering Player 2 a little more than half of each item.\n\nHere's my proposed offer:\n- Item 1: 2\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 5\n- Item 4: 1\n- Item 5: 3\n\nThis means I keep:\n- Item 1: 1\n- Item 2: 2\n- Item 3: 4\n- Item 4: 0\n- Item 5: 3\n\nLet's calculate the value of what I keep:\n- Item 1: 1 * 7 = 7\n- Item 2: 2 * 95 = 190\n- Item 3: 4 * 77 = 308\n- Item 4: 0 * 52 = 0\n- Item 5: 3 * 62 = 186\nMy total value = 7 + 190 + 308 + 0 + 186 = 691\n\nThis value (691) is greater than my outside offer (387).

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 4 x 1 + 65 x 3 + 79 x 1 + 58 x 4\n    which is 544 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 545. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Discounting that at the end of round 3 would be 864*0.9*0.9 = 699.84\n\nThis implies that a counteroffer of [2,3,3,0,2] and accepted next round is worth 654*0.9= 588.6\nA counteroffer that keeps most of the items is worth 699.84 if accepted next round. Let's test that counter offer:\ncounter offer: [3,4,9,1,6] - this is me keeping nothing, which has 0 value to me.\ncounter offer: [0,0,0,0,0] - this is me keeping everything, which has value 1518, and discounted at the end of round 3 becomes 1518*0.9 = 1366.2, then 1366.2*0.9 = 1229.58 which is very good!\n\nTo make the negotiation realistic let's try an offer of [1,1,3,0,4] meaning I would get 2 of item 1, 3 of item 2, 6 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 2 of item 5.\n\n2 * 7 + 3 * 95 + 6 * 77 + 1 * 52 + 2 * 62 = 14 + 285 + 462 + 52 + 124 = 937\n\nDiscounting to get it accepted next round gives 937 * 0.9 = 843.3\n\nOk, I think I will propose a counteroffer of [1, 1, 3, 0, 4].\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [1, 1, 3, 0, 4]}\n```",

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 3 units of item 1, 4 units of item 2, 9 units of item 3, 1 units of item 4, 6 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 34 for item 1, 4 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 79 for item 4, 58 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 1130. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 545. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 545. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 4 = 12 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 79 = 237 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 720 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    34 x 1 + 4 x 1 + 65 x 3 + 79 x 1 + 58 x 4\n    which is 544 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 545. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 2, 5, 1, 3]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 3, 3, 0, 2]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 3, 0, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 3, 0, 4]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 300. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 12 = 36 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 15 = 45 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 41 = 123 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 432 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 4, 1, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    12 x 0 + 15 x 3 + 41 x 4 + 62 x 1 + 14 x 2\n    which is 299 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 300. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 713. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 40 = 120 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 52 = 156 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 49 = 147 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 735 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 2, 4, 4, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    40 x 2 + 85 x 2 + 52 x 4 + 49 x 4 + 19 x 3\n    which is 711 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 713. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

So the present value of this offer is 650 * 0.9 = 585.\n\nMy outside offer is 18. Since 585 is much greater than 18, accepting the offer is better than walking away *right now*. However, we have to consider if we could make a better deal.\n\nPlayer 1 originally offered [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]. Player 2 countered with [0, 0, 0, 2, 2]. Given that I value item 3 highly and items 4 and 5 relatively low, I will propose a counteroffer that reflects this. I will aim to give Player 2 more of items 4 and 5, while keeping more of item 3 for myself.\n\nLet's try offering Player 2 [0, 0, 1, 3, 3]. This means I would get:\n* Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n* Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n* Item 3: 4 - 1 = 3 units\n* Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n* Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n(2 * 28) + (3 * 57) + (3 * 87) + (2 * 4) + (2 * 21) = 56 + 171 + 261 + 8 + 42 = 538\n\nNow, we need to discount this value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value of this offer is 538 * 0.9 = 484.2\n\nIf Player 2 accepts this offer, it's worse for me than accepting their previous offer. I will try a better offer.\n\nHow about offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 3]. This means I would get:\n* Item 1: 2 - 0 = 2 units\n* Item 2: 3 - 0 = 3 units\n* Item 3: 4 - 0 = 4 units\n* Item 4: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n* Item 5: 5 - 3 = 2 units\n\nMy value for this offer is:\n(2 * 28) + (3 * 57) + (4 * 87) + (2 * 4) + (2 * 21) = 56 + 171 + 348 + 8 + 42 = 625\n\nNow, we need to discount this value by gamma^(r-1) = 0.9^(2-1) = 0.9. So the present value of this offer is 625 * 0.9 = 562.5\n\nThis is still worse than accepting. Since this is round 2, I'm just going to accept their offer as that yields me more than my outside option, and trying for a better offer seems unlikely to succeed.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}\n```",

Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 655. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 655. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 93 = 279 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 80 = 240 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 45 = 135 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 11 = 33 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 66 = 198 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 885 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 1, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    93 x 4 + 80 x 2 + 45 x 1 + 11 x 1 + 66 x 1\n    which is 654 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 655. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

They offered me 2 units of item 2, suggesting they might value it less.\n\nI'll offer them more of the items I value less (item 1) and some of item 2, while keeping all of the high-value items 3 and 5 for myself:\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1: [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis gives me a value of 602, which is better than my outside offer of 507, and gives Player 1 some units of potentially valuable items.\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]}",

Since 176.4 < 439, accepting the current offer is worse than walking away.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer.

My round 1 offer was [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]. It seems they value item 1 highly since they offered to give me only 1 unit of item 2, a unit of item 3 and a unit of item 5 in exchange for 1 unit of item 1. It also seems they don't value the other items as much.\n\nI need to make an offer that is better than my walkaway value divided by the discount factor.\n439/0.9 = 487.78\n\nLet's try an offer where I give them most of item 1 and item 2 while keeping items 3 and 5 for myself.\n\nCounteroffer: [3, 4, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis means I get:\n- 1 unit of item 1\n- 1 unit of item 2\n- 2 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 2 units of item 5\n\nMy value is (1 * 67) + (1 * 62) + (2 * 20) + (0 * 44) + (2 * 46) = 67 + 62 + 40 + 0 + 92 = 261.\n\nThe discounted value is 261 * 0.9 = 234.9. This is still less than 439.\n\nWhat if I try offering them even more?\nCounteroffer: [3, 5, 1, 0, 1]\nI get\n- 1 units of item 1\n- 0 units of item 2\n- 1 units of item 3\n- 0 units of item 4\n- 1 units of item 5\nMy value is (1 * 67) + (0 * 62) + (1 * 20) + (0 * 44) + (1 * 46) = 67 + 0 + 20 + 0 + 46 = 133\n\nThe discounted value is 133 * 0.9 = 119.7.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 2, 3, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 1 + 39 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 67 x 1 + 21 x 4\n    which is 300 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 303. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 1, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    18 x 0 + 82 x 0 + 100 x 0 + 46 x 1 + 36 x 1\n    which is 82 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 86.

Based on their offer, I can't clearly determine their item preferences yet.\n\nI should make a counteroffer that prioritizes keeping my high-value items (items 2 and 3) while offering more of my low-value items (items 1 and 5). This gives me more value while potentially still being attractive to Player 1.\n\nMy counteroffer will be [4, 1, 1, 3, 1], which gives me a value of 792 (much higher than my outside offer of 86).\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 1, 1, 3, 1]}",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 2, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    98 x 2 + 33 x 4 + 13 x 2 + 21 x 2 + 53 x 2\n    which is 502 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 503. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 2, 1, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    6 x 0 + 13 x 0 + 49 x 2 + 54 x 1 + 8 x 4\n    which is 184 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 185. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 0, 0, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    87 x 0 + 99 x 0 + 68 x 0 + 54 x 0 + 18 x 2\n    which is 36 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 52. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "response": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the value of the current offer to me. The offer is [0, 1, 0, 6, 2]. This means I get:\n* 0 units of item 1\n* 1 units of item 2\n* 0 units of item 3\n* 6 units of item 4\n* 2 units of item 5\n\nMy values for these items are 57, 18, 68, 2, 52, respectively.\n\nSo the value of the current offer to me is:\n(0 * 57) + (1 * 18) + (0 * 68) + (6 * 2) + (2 * 52) = 0 + 18 + 0 + 12 + 104 = 134\n\nSince this is round 2, I need to discount this value by gamma^(2-1) = 0.9^1 = 0.9.\nDiscounted value = 134 * 0.9 = 120.6\n\nMy outside offer is 251. Since 120.6 is less than 251, I should not accept this offer.\n\nNow, let's consider making a counteroffer. I want to maximize my value, but I also need to consider that Player 2 will walk away if they don't get enough. I need to figure out what a reasonable counteroffer would be.\n\nIn the previous round, I offered [0, 2, 0, 5, 1] to Player 2. Player 2 countered with [0, 1, 0, 6, 2]. This indicates Player 2 values item 2 and item 5 more than I do, and item 4 less.\n\nLet's try to give Player 2 almost everything of items 2 and 5, and a little of item 4. I will offer [0, 3, 0, 6, 2] to Player 2.\nThis means I keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 1 unit of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 1 unit of item 4\n* 1 unit of item 5\n\nMy value for this is:\n(1 * 57) + (1 * 18) + (1 * 68) + (1 * 2) + (1 * 52) = 57 + 18 + 68 + 2 + 52 = 197\nDiscounted value = 197 * 0.9 = 177.3\n\nThis is still less than my outside offer of 251. I will try to offer a little less, so I can increase the number of items I keep.\nI will offer [0, 2, 0, 5, 1] to Player 2.\nThis means I keep:\n* 1 unit of item 1\n* 2 units of item 2\n* 1 unit of item 3\n* 2 units of item 4\n* 2 units of item 5\nMy value for this is:\n(1 * 57) + (2 * 18) + (1 * 68) + (2 * 2) + (2 * 52) = 57 + 36 + 68 + 4 + 104 = 269\nDiscounted value = 269 * 0.9 = 242.1\nStill less than 251.

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 2, 5, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    86 x 4 + 68 x 2 + 99 x 5 + 98 x 5 + 45 x 2\n    which is 1555 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1556. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

My goal is to maximize my discounted value, taking into account my outside offer of 424.\n\nSince I have no information about Player 2's values or outside offer, I should start with a reasonable offer that gives me a good value while leaving room for negotiation. A fair starting point might be to split the items roughly in half, prioritizing keeping the items I value most (item 5) and giving more of the items I value least (item 4) to Player 2.\n\nHere's a possible split I could offer to Player 2:\n\n*   Item 1: 2 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 3 units\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis leaves me with:\n\n*   Item 1: 3 units (3 * 28 = 84)\n*   Item 2: 3 units (3 * 37 = 111)\n*   Item 3: 1 units (1 * 28 = 28)\n*   Item 4: 2 units (2 * 25 = 50)\n*   Item 5: 0 units (0 * 100 = 0)\n\nMy total value for this split would be 84 + 111 + 28 + 50 + 0 = 273.\n\nThis value is less than my outside offer of 424. Therefore, I want to calculate the value of an equal split as well, and make that my counteroffer if it is above my outside offer.\n\n*   Item 1: 2.5 units\n*   Item 2: 3 units\n*   Item 3: 0.5 units\n*   Item 4: 2.5 units\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nIf I give these to player 2, the value to me is:\n*   Item 1: 2.5 units (2.5 * 28 = 70)\n*   Item 2: 3 units (3 * 37 = 111)\n*   Item 3: 0.5 units (0.5 * 28 = 14)\n*   Item 4: 2.5 units (2.5 * 25 = 62.5)\n*   Item 5: 0 units (0 * 100 = 0)\nTotal value = 70 + 111 + 14 + 62.5 = 257.5\nThis is much less than my outside offer.\n\nSince it is Round 1, I have the opportunity to make an offer. Let's try a more aggressive offer, giving Player 2 the minimum possible to still try and get a better outcome for me. I still want to beat my walkaway outcome of 424 after 3 rounds (meaning I need to achieve at least 424 / (0.9^2) = 523.46\n\nHow about I give Player 2 almost nothing:\n*   Item 1: 0 unit\n*   Item 2: 0 unit\n*   Item 3: 0 unit\n*   Item 4: 0 unit\n*   Item 5: 0 unit\n\nThis gives me:\n*   Item 1: 5 units (5 * 28 = 140)\n*   Item 2: 6 units (6 * 37 = 222)\n*   Item 3: 1 unit (1 * 28 = 28)\n*   Item 4: 5 units (5 * 25 = 125)\n*   Item 5: 0 unit (0 * 100 = 0)\nTotal value = 140 + 222 + 28 + 125 + 0 = 515\n\nThis is still not better than my walkaway. Let's try and trade item 4 for item 5 to player 2.\nGive Player 2 all of item 4:\n*   Item 1: 0 units\n*   Item 2: 0 units\n*   Item 3: 0 units\n*   Item 4: 5 units\n*   Item 5: 0 units\n\nThis leaves me:\n*   Item 1: 5 units (5 * 28 = 140)\n*   Item 2: 6 units (6 * 37 = 222)\n*   Item 3: 1 units (1 * 28 = 28)\n*   Item 4: 0 units (0 * 25 = 0)\n*   Item 5: 0 units (0 * 100 = 0)\nTotal Value = 390. This is still below my outside offer.\n\nWhat about giving only items 1, 2, 3, and 4 and keeping all of item 5.\n*   Item 1: 5\n*   Item 2: 6\n*   Item 3: 1\n*   Item 4: 5\n*   Item 5: 0\n\nThis would leave me with just item 5, value 0. That won't work.\n\nI think the best I can do is to give Player 2 2, 3, 0, 3, 0.\nThe value of this outcome is 273.\n\nGiven my discount factor is 0.9. This would mean my potential discounted payoff in round 3 is:\n\nI can achieve this discounted payoff: 424 / (0.9 ^ 2) = 523.46\n\nI am going to walk, since I cannot construct a valid offer above my walkaway point.\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 432. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 27 = 81 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 85 = 255 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 97 = 291 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 64 = 192 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 6 = 18 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 837 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 85 x 0 + 97 x 3 + 64 x 2 + 6 x 2\n    which is 431 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 432. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Keep in mind the offers the opposing agent makes reflects its own values. If their offer includes most or all units of a particular item, it might indicate that the agent does not highly value that item, whereas offering none could suggest the opposite. \n    You can use this kind of evidence to help inform your decision-making.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [3, 4, 4, 2, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 4, 4, 2, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

Items 1 and 5 have lower values for me.\n\nLet me formulate a counteroffer where I keep more of the high-value items:\nIf I offer Player 1 [5, 2, 1, 3, 2], I would keep [2, 6, 7, 2, 1]:\n- 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 27 = 54\n- 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 85 = 510\n- 7 units of item 3 = 7 \u00d7 97 = 679\n- 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 64 = 128\n- 1 unit of item 5 = 1 \u00d7 6 = 6\n\nTotal value for me = 1377\n\nThis counteroffer would be worth 1377 to me, which is better than the current offer (943) and my outside offer (432).\n\n## Step 4: Make a decision\n\nThe current offer (943) is already much better than my outside offer (432), but I can propose a counteroffer that's even better for me. It's the first round, so there's room for negotiation, and even with the discount factor, I can afford to make a counteroffer.\n\nI'll propose a counteroffer that gives me more of the items I value highly (items 2 and 3) while offering Player 1 more of the items I value less (items 1 and 5).\n\nMy counteroffer to Player 1 is [5, 2, 1, 3, 2].\n\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [5, 2, 1, 3, 2]}",
