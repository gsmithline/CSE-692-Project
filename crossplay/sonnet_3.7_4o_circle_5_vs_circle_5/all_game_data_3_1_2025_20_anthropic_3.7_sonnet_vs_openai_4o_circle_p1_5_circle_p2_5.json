By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 3, 3, 3, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party.

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 2, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    95 x 0 + 9 x 2 + 95 x 0 + 25 x 0 + 64 x 0\n    which is 18 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 19. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 1, 1]\n\n    What is your action?

However, I should consider making a counteroffer first.\n   - I need to propose a counteroffer that gives me a value greater than 888.\n\nTo propose a counteroffer, let's iterate through potential distributions to keep as many high-value items as possible. I will evaluate keeping more of the items that are valuable to me and propose a distribution where my value is optimal:\n\nSuppose I keep [1, 5, 1, 2, 5] and offer the remaining [1, 2, 1, 1, 1] to Player 1:\n   - Value from keeping 1 unit of item 1 = 1 \u00d7 63 = 63\n   - Value from keeping 5 units of item 2 = 5 \u00d7 51 = 255\n   - Value from keeping 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - Value from keeping 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n   - Value from keeping 5 units of item 5 = 5 \u00d7 79 = 395\n   - Total value = 63 + 255 + 3 + 140 + 395 = 856\n\nThe value of 856 is less than my outside offer, so I will need to adjust further to attempt to propose a more beneficial counteroffer.\n\nSuppose instead I keep [2, 6, 1, 2, 6] and offer [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] to Player 1:\n   - Value from keeping 2 units of item 1 = 2 \u00d7 63 = 126\n   - Value from keeping 6 units of item 2 = 6 \u00d7 51 = 306\n   - Value from keeping 1 unit of item 3 = 1 \u00d7 3 = 3\n   - Value from keeping 2 units of item 4 = 2 \u00d7 70 = 140\n   - Value from keeping 6 units of item 5 = 6 \u00d7 79 = 474\n   - Total value = 126 + 306 + 3 + 140 + 474 = 1049\n\nThe value of 1049 is greater than my outside offer of 888, making this a viable counteroffer.\n\nBased on this analysis, my action will be:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]}\n```",

This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 0, 2, 2, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    45 x 1 + 89 x 0 + 16 x 2 + 59 x 2 + 97 x 4\n    which is 583 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 586. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 3, 4, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    27 x 0 + 12 x 3 + 31 x 3 + 99 x 4 + 16 x 1\n    which is 541 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 542. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine my action, let's go through the analysis step by step:\n\n### 1) Analyze the current situation:\n\n- **What is my outside offer value?**\n  My outside offer value is 542.\n\n- **What are the values of the items involved?**\n  - Item 1: 27 per unit\n  - Item 2: 12 per unit\n  - Item 3: 31 per unit\n  - Item 4: 99 per unit\n  - Item 5: 16 per unit\n\n- **What is the total pool of items?**\n  - Total units of item 1: 5\n  - Total units of item 2: 3\n  - Total units of item 3: 5\n  - Total units of item 4: 5\n  - Total units of item 5: 3\n\n- **How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?**\n  The discount factor is 0.9. If the process concludes after round 1, the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by \\(0.9^{0}\\), which equals 1, meaning there is no discount. However, if I wait for future rounds, the value will be discounted by 0.9 per round.\n\n### 2) Assess the value of offers:\n\n- **For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?**\n\n  Current offer to me: [1, 2, 2, 3, 0]\n\n  - Value from item 1: \\(1 \\times 27 = 27\\)\n  - Value from item 2: \\(2 \\times 12 = 24\\)\n  - Value from item 3: \\(2 \\times 31 = 62\\)\n  - Value from item 4: \\(3 \\times 99 = 297\\)\n  - Value from item 5: \\(0 \\times 16 = 0\\)\n\n  Total value if I accept the offer = \\(27 + 24 + 62 + 297 + 0 = 410\\)\n\n- **For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?**\n  \n  I'll consider a potential counteroffer that is more beneficial than accepting Player 1's offer or my outside offer. Note that my values for the items are significant for item 4 and item 3. I should aim to maximize these.\n\n  I can propose to keep: [1, 1, 3, 4, 1], offering Player 1: [4, 2, 2, 1, 2]\n\n  - Value from item 1: \\(1 \\times 27 = 27\\)\n  - Value from item 2: \\(1 \\times 12 = 12\\)\n  - Value from item 3: \\(3 \\times 31 = 93\\)\n  - Value from item 4: \\(4 \\times 99 = 396\\)\n  - Value from item 5: \\(1 \\times 16 = 16\\)\n\n  Total value of this offer to me = \\(27 + 12 + 93 + 396 + 16 = 544\\)\n\n### 3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n\n- **Should I accept the current offer?**\n  No, the value of 410 is less than my outside offer of 542.\n\n- **Should I walk away and take my outside offer?**\n  Not immediately, as I can still propose a counteroffer more beneficial than both.\n\n- **Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?**\n  Yes, since I calculated a potential counteroffer value (544) that exceeds my outside offer value (542) and the current offer value (410).\n\nTherefore, I will propose the counteroffer where Player 1 receives [4, 2, 2, 1, 2] of the items:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [4, 2, 2, 1, 2]}\n```",

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 4, 1, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    94 x 0 + 54 x 1 + 77 x 4 + 75 x 1 + 45 x 0\n    which is 437 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 438. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Your value would be:\n    96 x 0 + 3 x 1 + 93 x 1 + 42 x 4 + 93 x 1\n    which is 357 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 358. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

According to the mistakes to avoid in the negotiation:\n\n- Accepting an offer worse for me than my outside offer would be a mistake.\n- Walking away from an offer better than my outside offer would also be a mistake.\n\nTherefore, the prudent action here, ensuring I don't make mistakes 4 or 5, is to accept the current offer as it is the best outcome given the circumstances.\n\n{\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"}",

You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 10, 4, 1, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 2 + 68 x 10 + 90 x 4 + 37 x 1 + 41 x 3\n    which is 1242 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1243. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 1, 2]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [3, 3, 2, 0, 3]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [3, 6, 2, 1, 5]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [3, 6, 2, 1, 5]\n\n    What is your action?

Making a counteroffer that reserves most high-value items for me might be worth trying, but if rejected, we'd still end up with our outside offers. Walking away guarantees my outside offer.\n\nThe best strategic choice is to WALK away, as it gives me the guaranteed value of 1243, which is better than the discounted value of the current offer (723.33).\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Item 4 (87)\n2. Item 3 (79)\n3. Item 5 (59)\n4. Item 2 (44)\n5.

Accepting this would make Mistake 4.\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: I need to propose a division that ensures my continued value exceeds 765.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1049. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 29 = 87 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 957 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [4, 4, 3, 5, 2] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    29 x 4 + 58 x 4 + 84 x 3 + 50 x 5 + 98 x 2\n    which is 1046 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1049. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To decide on the appropriate action, let's analyze step by step based on the provided instructions:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n- **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 1049.\n  \n- **Values of Items**: \n  - Item 1: 29 per unit\n  - Item 2: 58 per unit\n  - Item 3: 84 per unit\n  - Item 4: 50 per unit\n  - Item 5: 98 per unit\n\n- **Total Pool of Items**:\n  - 5 units of item 1\n  - 4 units of item 2\n  - 3 units of item 3\n  - 5 units of item 4\n  - 3 units of item 5\n\n- **Discount Factor**: The discount factor is 0.9 and impacts the overall value of the negotiation such that the value is reduced by this factor raised to the power of the number of rounds - 1.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n- **Current Offer (Player 1's Offer)**: \n  - 0 units of item 1 = 0 \u00d7 29 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 2 = 0 \u00d7 58 = 0\n  - 0 units of item 3 = 0 \u00d7 84 = 0\n  - 5 units of item 4 = 5 \u00d7 50 = 250\n  - 0 units of item 5 = 0 \u00d7 98 = 0\n  - Total Value = 250\n\nThis value is significantly less than my outside offer value of 1049, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n- **Potential Counteroffers**: \n  I need to propose a division that offers me a value greater than my outside offer of 1049. Let\u2019s calculate an offer where I end up with a higher value than 1049.\n\nLet's say I propose the following counteroffer, where I gain most of the higher-value items:\n- **Counteroffer**: I will keep majority higher-valued items for me:\n  - I keep [5, 4, 3, 0, 3], and offer Player 1 the rest [0, 0, 0, 5, 0]:\n  - Calculation for me:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n    - 4 units of item 2 = 4 \u00d7 58 = 232\n    - 3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252\n    - 0 units of item 4 = 0 \u00d7 50 = 0\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - Total Value = 923\n\nThis total value is still less than my outside offer of 1049.\n\nContinue to iterate for a more advantageous offer. Let's adjust the offer:\n- **Counteroffer**: I will keep excess of higher valued items:\n  - I keep [5, 3, 2, 1, 3], and offer Player 1 [0, 1, 1, 4, 0]:\n  - Calculation for me:\n    - 5 units of item 1 = 5 \u00d7 29 = 145\n    - 3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - 2 units of item 3 = 2 \u00d7 84 = 168\n    - 1 units of item 4 = 1 \u00d7 50 = 50\n    - 3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 98 = 294\n    - Total Value = 831\n\nThis total value remains less than my outside offer of 1049. Let's readjust further.\n\n### Step 3: Make a Decision\nBased on the calculations, neither the current offer nor the calculated counteroffers provide me with a value equal to or greater than my outside offer. Therefore, according to strategic error guidelines, offering a counteroffer less than my outside offer is not preferable.\n\nThus, I will decide to WALK away to receive my outside offer value.\n\n**Action**: \n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 1, 5, 3, 7] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    49 x 0 + 38 x 1 + 71 x 5 + 87 x 3 + 36 x 7\n    which is 906 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 907. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 3.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 0, 2, 1, 4]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [2, 0, 3, 3, 4]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [3, 0, 2, 1, 4]\nRound 2: Player 2 offered [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to analyze the current offer and determine my best action. Let's work through this step by step.\n\n1) Current situation analysis:\n   - My outside offer value: 907\n   - My item values: item 1 = 49, item 2 = 38, item 3 = 71, item 4 = 87, item 5 = 36\n   - Total pool: 5 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 7 units of item 3, 6 units of item 4, 7 units of item 5\n   - This is round 3, so the discount factor would be 0.9\u00b2 = 0.81 if we complete this round\n\n2) Assess the value of the current offer:\n   Player 2's offer gives me: [1, 0, 2, 3, 4]\n   This means I would keep: 4 units of item 1, 1 unit of item 2, 5 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, 3 units of item 5\n   \n   My value calculation:\n   - 4 units of item 1: 4 \u00d7 49 = 196\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n   - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n   - 3 units of item 4: 3 \u00d7 87 = 261\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   \n   Total raw value = 958\n   With discount factor (0.81): 958 \u00d7 0.81 = 776.0\n\n   This is LESS than my outside offer of 907, so accepting would be a mistake.\n\n3) Decision analysis:\n   Since accepting the current offer would give me less than my outside offer (776 vs 907), I should not accept.\n   \n   Since this is the final round and we have a discount factor of 0.81, any counteroffer I make would be subject to this discount.\n   To make a counteroffer worthwhile, I need to ensure I keep enough to exceed my outside offer even after discounting.\n   \n   I need at least 907/0.81 = 1120 in raw value to exceed my outside offer after discounting.\n   \n   Let me consider a counteroffer where I prioritize keeping the highest value items (item 4 at 87 and item 3 at 71):\n   If I offer [2, 0, 2, 1, 4] to Player 2, I would keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n   - 5 units of item 3: 5 \u00d7 71 = 355\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   \n   Total raw value = 1083\n   With discount (0.81): 1083 \u00d7 0.81 = 877.2\n\n   This is still less than my outside offer of 907. Let me try another option.\n   \n   If I offer [2, 0, 1, 1, 4] to Player 2, I would keep:\n   - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 49 = 147\n   - 1 unit of item 2: 1 \u00d7 38 = 38\n   - 6 units of item 3: 6 \u00d7 71 = 426\n   - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 87 = 435\n   - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 36 = 108\n   \n   Total raw value = 1154\n   With discount (0.81): 1154 \u00d7 0.81 = 935.0\n\n   This exceeds my outside offer of 907.\n\nHowever, since this is round 3 and any counteroffer I make would lead to Player 2 automatically walking away (per the rules, if the game gets to the last round and player 2 makes a counteroffer, it's treated as a WALK), I need to consider if I should walk away myself.\n\nIf I walk away now, I get my full outside offer of 907.\nIf I make a counteroffer, Player 2 will walk and I get 907.\n\nSince I can't get more than my outside offer in this situation, and accepting would give me less, the rational choice is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]\n\n    What is your action? You can:\n    - ACCEPT to accept the current offer\n    - WALK to walk away\n    - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your counteroffer (what you give to Player 1)",
                    "response": "To determine the best course of action, we'll analyze the current situation step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Current Situation\n\n1. **Outside Offer Value**: My outside offer value is 568.\n\n2. **Values of the Items**:\n   - Item 1: 46 per unit\n   - Item 2: 13 per unit\n   - Item 3: 78 per unit\n   - Item 4: 11 per unit\n   - Item 5: 67 per unit\n\n3. **Total Pool of Items**:\n   - Item 1: 3 units\n   - Item 2: 6 units\n   - Item 3: 3 units\n   - Item 4: 4 units\n   - Item 5: 4 units\n\n4. **Discount Factor Influence**: The discount factor (gamma = 0.9) affects the value based on the number of rounds. In round 1, the value is not discounted, but it would be multiplied by 0.9 in round 2 if I wait for future offers.\n\n### Step 2: Assess the Value of Offers\n\n1. **Current Offer Value**: Calculate the total value for me if I accept the current offer [0, 1, 2, 3, 1]:\n\n   - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 46 = 0\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 13 = 13\n   - Item 3: 2 units \u00d7 78 = 156\n   - Item 4: 3 units \u00d7 11 = 33\n   - Item 5: 1 unit \u00d7 67 = 67\n\n   Total value = 0 + 13 + 156 + 33 + 67 = 269\n\n2. **Comparison to Outside Offer**: The current offer's value (269) is lower than my outside offer (568).\n\n3. **Potential Counteroffers**: To form a counteroffer better than the outside offer, I need to keep enough items with a value exceeding 568. Let's propose an offer and calculate:\n\n   - If I keep all units of item 3 and 5, and offer [3, 6, 0, 4, 0] to Player 1.\n\n   My share would be:\n\n   - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 46 = 0\n   - Item 2: 0 units \u00d7 13 = 0\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 78 = 234\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 11 = 0\n   - Item 5: 4 units \u00d7 67 = 268\n\n   Total value = 0 + 0 + 234 + 0 + 268 = 502\n   \n   This is less than my outside offer. \n   \n   I need to iterate and find an alternative.\n\nAnother attempt:\n   \n   - If I keep 1 unit of item 2, all units of item 3, 3 units of item 5 (giving able to offer [3, 5, 0, 4, 1] to Player 1).\n\n   My share would be:\n\n   - Item 1: 0 units \u00d7 46 = 0\n   - Item 2: 1 unit \u00d7 13 = 13\n   - Item 3: 3 units \u00d7 78 = 234\n   - Item 4: 0 units \u00d7 11 = 0\n   - Item 5: 3 unit \u00d7 67 = 201\n\n   Total value = 0 + 13 + 234 + 0 + 201 = 448\n   \n   This is still less than my outside offer. \n\nAfter calculations, if nothing results above 568, I should WALK.\n\n### Step 3: Decision\n\nGiven the current offer is valued at 269 for me and is significantly less than my outside offer of 568, the best decision is to WALK away from negotiations.\n\nSo, my action is:\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 513. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis.

This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 1 + 62 x 3 + 20 x 2 + 21 x 4 + 38 x 4\n    which is 512 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 513.

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 513. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 513. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 50 = 150 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 62 = 186 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 20 = 60 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 21 = 63 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 573 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 3, 2, 4, 4] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    50 x 1 + 62 x 3 + 20 x 2 + 21 x 4 + 38 x 4\n    which is 512 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 513. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [0, 0, 5, 1, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 2, 0, 1, 3]\n\n    What is your action?

In round 2, the discount factor applies once, so the current offer or any negotiated deal would only be worth 90% of the original calculated value if accepted in round 2.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n- **Current Offer**: [0, 0, 2, 1, 1] (means I receive 4 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 4 units of item 5)\n  - Total value if I accept this offer:\n    - 0 units of item 1: 0 \u00d7 20 = 0\n    - 0 units of item 2: 0 \u00d7 86 = 0\n    - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n    - 3 units of item 4: 1 \u00d7 10 = 10\n    - 4 units of item 5: 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n    - Total value = 244 + 10 + 26 = 280\n    - Adjusted for discount: 280 \u00d7 0.9 = 252\n- **Comparison to Outside Offer**:\n  - The adjusted current offer value (252) is much less than my outside offer (614).\n\n### 3) Make a Decision:\n- **Mistake Prevention**:\n  - I should not ACCEPT an offer worse than my outside offer, which means rejecting the current offer.\n  - I should not make a counteroffer that leaves me worse off than my outside offer unless it's likely to lead to a better outcome in round 3.\n  - Since this is round 2, I can propose a counteroffer.\n\n### Counteroffer Calculation:\nTo maximize my value and surpass my outside offer, I'd prefer to maximize higher valued items (item 2 and item 3). Let's try crafting an offer I can propose that retains more high-value items for me:\n- If I keep [1, 2, 4, 2, 4] (which gives away 0 of items [2, 2, 2, 2, 1]), then my value would be:\n  - 1 unit of item 1: 1 \u00d7 20 = 20\n  - 2 units of item 2: 2 \u00d7 86 = 172\n  - 4 units of item 3: 4 \u00d7 61 = 244\n  - 2 units of item 4: 2 \u00d7 10 = 20\n  - 4 units of item 5: 4 \u00d7 26 = 104\n  - Total value = 20 + 172 + 244 + 20 + 104 = 560\n  - Adjusted for discount: 560 \u00d7 0.9 = 504\n\n- The above total value of 504 (post-discount) is still less than my outside offer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that my adjusted value is worse with the offer and the potential revised offer post-discount still does not reach my outside offer, the best course of action is to WALK away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 486. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 8 = 24 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 86 = 258 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 63 = 189 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 23 = 69 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 636 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 4, 3, 2, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    32 x 0 + 8 x 4 + 86 x 3 + 63 x 2 + 23 x 3\n    which is 485 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 486. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",
                    "response": "I need to carefully analyze this negotiation to maximize my value while ensuring I don't make any of the five common mistakes.\n\n## Step 1: Analyze the current situation\n\n- My outside offer value: 486\n- My private values per unit: \n  - Item 1: 32 (3 units available)\n  - Item 2: 8 (4 units available)\n  - Item 3: 86 (3 units available)\n  - Item 4: 63 (10 units available)\n  - Item 5: 23 (3 units available)\n- Total pool: 3 of item 1, 4 of item 2, 3 of item 3, 10 of item 4, 3 of item 5\n- This is round 1, so the discount factor (\u03b3 = 0.9) is \u03b3^(1-1) = 1, meaning no discount yet\n\n## Step 2: Determine the total value of all items\n\nI need to calculate the total value of all items to me:\n- Item 1: 3 \u00d7 32 = 96\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 8 = 32\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- Item 4: 10 \u00d7 63 = 630\n- Item 5: 3 \u00d7 23 = 69\n- Total value: 1085\n\n## Step 3: Strategize my initial offer\n\nI should prioritize keeping high-value items for myself. Looking at the per-unit values:\n- Item 3 (86) is most valuable to me\n- Item 4 (63) is second most valuable\n- Item 1 (32) is moderate value\n- Item 5 (23) is lower value\n- Item 2 (8) is least valuable to me\n\nA strategic initial offer should give away items with low value to me while keeping the high-value items. Let me try an initial offer:\n\nIf I offer to Player 2:\n- Item 1: 1 unit (keeping 2 for myself)\n- Item 2: 3 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n- Item 3: 0 units (keeping all 3 for myself)\n- Item 4: 3 units (keeping 7 for myself)\n- Item 5: 2 units (keeping 1 for myself)\n\nValue I keep:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 32 = 64\n- Item 2: 1 \u00d7 8 = 8\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 86 = 258\n- Item 4: 7 \u00d7 63 = 441\n- Item 5: 1 \u00d7 23 = 23\n- Total: 794\n\nThis is significantly better than my outside offer of 486, so this would be a good initial offer.\n\n## Step 4: Verify against the five mistakes\n\n- Mistake 1: Not applicable as this is my first offer\n- Mistake 2: My offer gives me 794, which is better than my outside offer of 486\n- Mistake 3: I'm not offering nothing or everything to the opponent\n- Mistake 4: Not applicable as I'm not accepting an offer\n- Mistake 5: Not applicable as I'm not walking away\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll make an initial counteroffer of [1, 3, 0, 3, 2], which represents giving 1 unit of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 0 units of item 3, 3 units of item 4, and 2 units of item 5 to Player 2.

Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 913. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 19 = 57 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 32 = 96 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 81 = 243 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 83 = 249 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 867 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 0, 7, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    19 x 0 + 32 x 3 + 74 x 0 + 81 x 7 + 83 x 3\n    which is 912 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 913. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 967. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 38 = 114 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 60 = 180 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 37 = 111 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 14 = 42 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 77 = 231 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 678 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [2, 4, 5, 0, 6] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    38 x 2 + 60 x 4 + 37 x 5 + 14 x 0 + 77 x 6\n    which is 963 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 967. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action?

Assessing the value of offers:\n\nFirst, I'll evaluate Player 2's current offer to me: [0, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n\nThis means I would keep:\n- Item 1: 2 units (all remain with me)\n- Item 2: 4 units (5 total - 1 to Player 2)\n- Item 3: 3 units (5 total - 2 to Player 2)\n- Item 4: 0 units (1 total - 1 to Player 2)\n- Item 5: 4 units (6 total - 2 to Player 2)\n\nMy value if I accept this offer:\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n- Item 2: 4 \u00d7 60 = 240\n- Item 3: 3 \u00d7 37 = 111\n- Item 4: 0 \u00d7 14 = 0\n- Item 5: 4 \u00d7 77 = 308\n- Total value = 735\n\nWith discount factor: 735 \u00d7 0.9 = 661.5\n\nThis is less than my outside offer of 967, so I should not accept this offer.\n\n## 3. Developing a counteroffer:\n\nI need to create a counteroffer that gives me value higher than my outside offer. Since I'm in round 2, I need to account for the 0.9 discount factor.\n\nMy total possible value (all items):\n- Item 1: 2 \u00d7 38 = 76\n- Item 2: 5 \u00d7 60 = 300\n- Item 3: 5 \u00d7 37 = 185\n- Item 4: 1 \u00d7 14 = 14\n- Item 5: 6 \u00d7 77 = 462\n- Total = 1037\n\nI need at least 967/0.9 = 1074.44 undiscounted value, which is actually more than all items combined.\n\nThis means I need to keep almost everything to get close to my outside offer value. Let me try different combinations:\n\nIf I keep all items except:\n- Give 1 unit of Item 3 (value 37) and 1 unit of Item 4 (value 14)\n  My value = 1037 - 37 - 14 = 986\n  With discount: 986 \u00d7 0.9 = 887.4 (less than 967)\n\nLet's try another allocation. If I give away:\n- 0 units of Item 1 (keeping 2)\n- 0 units of Item 2 (keeping 5)\n- 1 unit of Item 3 (keeping 4)\n- 0 units of Item 4 (keeping 1)\n- 0 units of Item 5 (keeping 6)\n  My value = 1037 - 37 = 1000\n  With discount: 1000 \u00d7 0.9 = 900 (less than 967)\n\nI need to maximize my value while still making a reasonable offer. Since I can't reach my outside offer with the discount factor, my best option is to WALK away.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any counteroffer that gets me close:\nIf I offer [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]:\n- I keep 2 of item 1, 5 of item 2, 5 of item 3, 1 of item 4, 5 of item 5\n- My value = 76 + 300 + 185 + 14 + 5\u00d777 = 960\n- With discount: 960 \u00d7 0.9 = 864 (less than 967)\n\nI've tried several combinations, and none exceed my outside offer value after applying the discount factor. The best decision is to walk away.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

Player 2 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 1249. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 1249. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 84 = 252 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 36 = 108 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 72 = 216 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 99 = 297 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 34 = 102 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 975 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [3, 7, 2, 5, 3] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    84 x 3 + 36 x 7 + 72 x 2 + 99 x 5 + 34 x 3\n    which is 1245 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 1249. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 1.\n    \n Negotiation history:\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): None\n\n        What is your action? As the first player, your available actions are:\n        - WALK to walk away\n        - A list of numbers [n1, n2, ...] representing your initial offer (what you give to Player 2)",

If we reach an agreement in round 2, values would be multiplied by 0.9, and in round 3 by 0.81.\n\n2) Value assessment for potential offers:\n   I need to determine what I want to keep versus offer to Player 2.

Total value to me:\n  - 2 units of item 1: 2 \u00d7 6 = 12\n  - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n  - 1 unit of item 3: 1 \u00d7 97 = 97\n  - 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 25 = 150\n  - 2 units of item 5: 2 \u00d7 77 = 154\n- Total value = 601\n\nThe resulting total value of 601 is below my outside offer of 953. Let's refine it one more time:\n\nFinal Counteroffer:\n\n- Keep [3, 4, 2, 6, 3] and offer [0, 3, 0, 0, 1] to Player 1. Total value to me:\n  - 3 units of item 1: 3 \u00d7 6 = 18\n  - 4 units of item 2: 4 \u00d7 47 = 188\n  - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 97 = 194\n  - 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 25 = 150\n  - 3 units of item 5: 3 \u00d7 77 = 231\n- Total value = 781, which is still less than my outside offer by a significant margin.\n\nUltimately, considering the constraints where offering a division different beyond item 5 would still remain below the 953 value threshold or become unrealistic compared to offers already presented, my best course is to walk away.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should WALK because each new counteroffer tested carries the potential to worsen my standing relative to the outside offer and my fallback position, leading to unwarranted opportunity costs.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 3, 1, 5, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    62 x 0 + 11 x 3 + 80 x 1 + 99 x 5 + 16 x 1\n    which is 624 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 625. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

I should consider making a counteroffer that yields a value greater than my outside offer. Let's find a suitable counteroffer by proposing to keep items that maximize my value:\n\n- If I keep [6, 3, 3, 5, 1] (offering [0, 0, 0, 1, 4] to Player 1):\n  - Value to keep:\n    - 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n    - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - 5 units of item 4: 5 \u00d7 20 = 100\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n  - Total Value: 522 + 279 + 174 + 100 + 40 = 1115\n  - Since 1115 is still less than 1283, I need a better offer for me. Let's try:\n\n- If I keep [6, 3, 2, 6, 1] (offering [0, 0, 1, 0, 4] to Player 1):\n  - Value to keep:\n    - 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n    - 2 units of item 3: 2 \u00d7 58 = 116\n    - 6 units of item 4: 6 \u00d7 20 = 120\n    - 1 unit of item 5: 1 \u00d7 40 = 40\n  - Total Value: 522 + 279 + 116 + 120 + 40 = 1077\n\nEven this value is less than my outside offer. To prevent walking away and to hopefully arrive at the best possible counter, let's push some items I value less:\n\n- If I keep [6, 3, 3, 4, 0] (offering [0, 0, 0, 2, 5] to Player 1):\n  - Value to keep:\n    - 6 units of item 1: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n    - 3 units of item 2: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n    - 3 units of item 3: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - 4 units of item 4: 4 \u00d7 20 = 80\n    - 0 unit of item 5: 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n  - Total Value: 522 + 279 + 174 + 80 = 1055\n\nAdjusting again:\n\nIf I keep [6, 3, 3, 3, 0] (offering [0, 0, 0, 3, 5] to Player 1):\n  - Value to keep:\n    - 6 items of item 1: 6 \u00d7 87 = 522\n    - 3 items of item 2: 3 \u00d7 93 = 279\n    - 3 items of item 3: 3 \u00d7 58 = 174\n    - 3 items of item 4: 3 \u00d7 20 = 60\n    - 0 items of item 5: 0 \u00d7 40 = 0\n  - Total Value: 522 + 279 + 174 + 60 = 1035\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven that all practical offers fall below my outside offer, I must walk away, as there's no viable counteroffer above 1283.\n\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}",

If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal.

By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    21 x 1 + 54 x 1 + 95 x 0 + 70 x 0 + 71 x 0\n    which is 75 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 82. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK.

                    "prompt": "\n    You and another agent have to negotiate a division of items between the two of you.\n    You are Player 2 and the other agent is Player 1.\n    There are 5 types of items, called item 1 through item 5.\n    There are 2 units of item 1, 3 units of item 2, 3 units of item 3, 2 units of item 4, 2 units of item 5 to divide.\n    Both you and Player 1 have a private value per unit of each item type.\n    These values are drawn from a uniform random distribution, ranging from 1 to 101.\n    Your private values are 26 for item 1, 5 for item 2, 65 for item 3, 74 for item 4, 25 for item 5.\n    You have a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to your total value of all items, which is 460. Player 1 has a private outside offer drawn from a uniform random distribution ranging from 1 to to their total value of all items.\n    Your outside offer value is 369. Your objective is to maximize your value of the outcome of the negotiation game. Remember, you have a guaranteed alternative: your outside offer.\n\n    Before making any counteroffer, you should calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value of 369. \n    For example, if you were considering offering the other player 2 units of each item (keeping 3 units of each for yourself), you would calculate:\n    3 units of item 1 = 3 \u00d7 26 = 78 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 2 = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 3 = 3 \u00d7 65 = 195 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 4 = 3 \u00d7 74 = 222 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    3 units of item 5 = 3 \u00d7 25 = 75 (multiplying units by your value per unit)\n    Total value = 585 (sum of all item values)\n    \n    The negotiation proceeds in 3 rounds.\n    There is a discount rate gamma = 0.9, such that if the process concludes after r rounds the overall value of the negotiation to each player is their value for the outcome multiplied by gamma to the power (r-1).\n    At each round, Player 1 takes an action, followed by Player 2.\n    The possible actions are to ACCEPT the other player's current offer (if any), make a COUNTEROFFER, or WALK away.  If the game gets to the last round, and player 2 chooses to make a counteroffer, this is treated as a WALK.\n    If a player chooses ACCEPT, the negotiation ends in a deal to divide the items according to the accepted offer.\n    The value of an outcome is determined by each player's private values per unit of each item and the quantities they receive in the deal. This value is adjusted by the discount factor, which is used to compute the present value of the negotiation outcome.\n    If a player chooses WALK, the negotiation ends without a deal, and each player receives the value of their private outside offer.\n\n    The following step-by-step questions are designed to guide you through a comprehensive analysis. By systematically addressing these questions, you can evaluate the current state of the negotiation, assess potential offers, and make informed decisions. You must use the information that you acquired through the step-by-step questioning above to decide what action you will make.\n    Let's walk through this step by step:\n\n    1) First, analyze the current situation:\n       - What is my outside offer value?\n       - What are the values of the items involved?\n       - What is the total pool of items?\n       - How does the discount factor influence the value of accepting the current offer versus waiting for future offers?\n\n    2) Assess the value of offers:\n       - For the current offer (if any): What is my total value if I accept it?\n       - For potential counteroffers: What would be my total value for different proposed divisions?\n       - How do these values compare to my outside offer value?\n\n    3) Make a decision based on the analysis:\n       - Should I accept the current offer?\n       - Should I walk away and take my outside offer?\n       - Or should I propose a specific counteroffer?\n\n    In the bargaining game, there are five mistakes you can make that conflict with your objectives. \n    While these aren't the only possible errors, they represent undesirable negotiation behaviors that can undermine your payoff or cause you to miss out on better deals. \n    These mistakes are:\n    - Mistake 1: Making an offer worse than your previous offer. This occurs when you reject an offer better for you than the one you subsequently propose. \n    - Mistake 2: Making an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This happens if you propose giving away so much that what you keep is worth less than your guaranteed alternative, which is your outside offer.\n    - Mistake 3: Offering no items or all items. Offering nothing (or everything) to the opponent (in the early or middle rounds) can be a clear suboptimal move. \n    - Mistake 4: Accepting an offer worse for you than your outside offer. This occurs if you accept a division that yields a payoff lower than your guaranteed fallback.\n    - Mistake 5: Walking away from an offer better than your outside offer. This occurs when you reject a division that actually yields a higher payoff than your fallback.\n\n    To prevent these mistakes, adopt a strategy similar to the following example: Before making any counteroffer, \n    calculate its total value to you and compare it to your outside offer value. For instance, suppose you keep only [0, 0, 3, 2, 1] items and offer the rest to the other party. Your value would be:\n    26 x 0 + 5 x 0 + 65 x 3 + 74 x 2 + 25 x 1\n    which is 368 (sum of all item values) \n    \n    which is less than your outside offer of 369. If your proposed offer results in a value lower than your outside offer, continue iterating until you develop a more advantageous offer that is better than your outside offer. \n    This reasoning can be applied to each of the five highlighted mistakes to ensure that your offers align with your objectives and avoid undesirable negotiation behaviors.\n\n    Please show your reasoning step by step, then provide your action in one of these formats in your response (if you do not do this your response will be invalid):\n    {\"action\": \"ACCEPT\"} - to accept the current offer\n    {\"action\": \"WALK\"} - to walk away from negotiations  \n    {\"action\": \"COUNTEROFFER\", \"offer\": [n1, n2, ...]} - where n1, n2, ... are numbers representing the number of units of each item being offered to the other player as part of the counteroffer.\n\n    Any response not in these exact formats will be invalid and treated as a WALK. If you provide a counteroffer, it must be a valid offer, otherwise it will be treated as a WALK.\n\n    It is now round 2.\n    \n Negotiation history:\nRound 1: Player 1 offered [2, 1, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 1: Player 2 offered [1, 2, 0, 0, 0]\nRound 2: Player 1 offered [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nCurrent offer on the table (the amount of each item being offered to you): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\n    What is your action?

                    "response": "To make an informed decision, let's break down the current situation and analyze the options.\n\n### 1) Analyze the Current Situation:\n\n- **My outside offer value**: 369.\n- **Values of the items**: \n  - Item 1: 26\n  - Item 2: 5\n  - Item 3: 65\n  - Item 4: 74\n  - Item 5: 25\n- **Total pool of items**:\n  - Item 1: 2 units\n  - Item 2: 3 units\n  - Item 3: 3 units\n  - Item 4: 2 units\n  - Item 5: 2 units\n- **Discount factor influence** at round 2 (gamma = 0.9): The value of any deal will be multiplied by 0.9 in round 2.\n\n### 2) Assess the Value of Offers:\n\n- **Current offer [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]**: \n  - My value = (1 \u00d7 26) + (1 \u00d7 5) + (0) + (0) + (0) = 26 + 5 = 31\n  - Adjusted for round 2 discount = 31 \u00d7 0.9 = 27.9\n\n- **Comparison to outside offer**: 27.9 (current offer value with discount) compared to 369 (outside offer).\n\nThe current offer provides significantly less value than my outside offer.\n\n### 3) Decision Making:\n\n- **Current Offer**: The current offer (value 27.9) is much worse than my outside offer (369).\n- **Counteroffers**: I need to both propose a division that satisfies Player 1 but also surpasses the value of my outside offer. \n\n  Let's explore a potential counteroffer: Aim to maximize my possession of high-value items (items 3 and 4) while finding a compromise on the others.\n  \n  **Example Counteroffer Strategy**: Offer Player 1 something like [1, 2, 1, 0, 1]\n  which leaves me with [1, 1, 2, 2, 1] as my hold.\n\n  - My value = \n    - 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n    - 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n    - 2 \u00d7 65 = 130\n    - 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n    - 1 \u00d7 25 = 25\n  - Total value = 26 + 5 + 130 + 148 + 25 = 334\n\n  Since 334 is lower than 369 (my outside offer), further adjust:\n\n  **Next Proposal**: [1, 2, 0, 0, 2] where I keep [1, 1, 3, 2, 0].\n\n  - My value = \n    - 1 \u00d7 26 = 26\n    - 1 \u00d7 5 = 5\n    - 3 \u00d7 65 = 195\n    - 2 \u00d7 74 = 148\n    - 0 \u00d7 25 = 0\n  - Total value = 26 + 5 + 195 + 148 = 374\n\n  Adjusted for round 2 discount = 374 \u00d7 0.9 = 336.6\n\n  This value is still lower than my outside offer. Thus, I cannot propose this unless higher value adjustments are made upfront.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the constraints and discounting effect, a rational action involves ensuring the offer outweighs the outside guaranteed value. Since the suggested counter isn't optimal vis-\u00e0-vis my fallback, there are diminishing returns on iterating further in this response, perhaps \"WALK\" is the pragmatic choice:\n\n```json\n{\"action\": \"WALK\"}\n```",
